<p>It would be regrettable if the work did not attract fully the attention
of the scientific world; its deep sobriety and the fulness of its
details render it a treasury of information, primarily for the physician,
but, in large measure, of interest also to the educationist, the minister,
the teacher and, not least, to the student of criminology....<br />

</p>

<p>It is Stekel’s extraordinary merit that he compels us to take into
account a pressing mass of data which he brings to light with a scientific
zeal which is unfortunately still rare,—facts and observations so
penetrating, so true to life that these often render unnecessary any
formal statement of the obvious deductions which flow from them.<br />

the earlier stages of psychoanalysis are avoided.<br />

</p>

<p>All in all, Stekel’s is a work for which I bespeak the widest interest
not only among physicians, but also among jurists, educationists,
sociologists and ministers. Only an understanding of the mental life
of the individual will yield a proper view of our social life.<br />
<i>Liepmann</i>, in <span class="smcap">Zeitschrift f. Sexualwissensch</span>.

</p>

<p>It does not matter from what angle the work of Stekel is approached.
Any consideration of it reveals rich material. Stekel is
a writer who handles his subjects in a lavish manner; lavish, but with
that restraint which bends all to the urgency of his themes. He evidently
approaches his clinical work with the same exuberant interest.
There he reaps through psychoanalysis a rich harvest of results. He has
collected these results and presented them for the dissemination of such
knowledge of the sexual disturbances as he thus obtained. Facts are there
in great number. They cannot be gainsaid. Stekel’s own evaluation of
such facts and his earnest plea for their consideration, both by the medical
profession and by the society of men and women where these facts
exist, can speak only for themselves to the truly conscientious reader.
There is not much in these books that the psychotherapeutist can afford
to pass over.<br />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Preface"><i>Preface</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The present work is the English version of a part
of one of the volumes in the author’s massive series
of clinical studies bearing the generic title, <i>Disorders
of the Instincts and Emotions</i> and covering the
whole range of the so-called <i>Parapathic Maladies</i>.
The translation represents approximately one-half
of the <i>Homosexualität</i> of the volume entitled <i>Onanie
und Homosexualität</i>, and bearing the sub-title, <i>Die
Homosexuelle Neurose</i>. The balance of the <i>Homosexual
Neurosis</i> and the author’s clinical study of
<i>Autoerotism</i> are also translated and will appear
shortly.</p>

<p>It is the author’s intention, and mine as his translator,
to issue an English version of all the volumes
in this comprehensive series. In addition to the
subjects covered in the present volume and in the
two volumes to follow shortly, the <i>Disorders of the
Instincts and the Emotions</i> include the <i>Anxiety
States</i>, <i>Female Frigidity</i>, <i>Male Impotence</i>, <i>Infantilism</i>
(including <i>Exhibitionism</i> and <i>Fetichism</i>), the
<i>Compulsion Neuroses</i> and <i>Morbid Doubts</i>. The
range of the subjects and the plan of the volumes
already published show that the series as conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
by the author forms a complete clinical account of
the psychogenetic disorders, and represents the most
recent development of scientific research. Since the
genetic study of these parapathic maladies involves
a thorough understanding of the facts of sexual life
Dr. Stekel’s works on the <i>Disorders of the Instincts
and the Emotions</i> constitute incidentally the latest
practical reference Handbook of Sexual Science in
the light of our newer knowledge and should prove
also on that score of inestimable value to the medical
and the allied learned professions.</p>

<p>The absence of formal systematic instruction in
the Principles and Practice of Psychoanalysis in
spite of the wide interest that the subject has deservedly
aroused in our midst is highly regrettable,
the more so since the lack of systematic instruction
in our country deprives the older practitioners as
well as the oncoming generations of physicians of an
opportunity to familiarize themselves with this most
important branch of therapy. Even though the
curriculum of instruction in our schools, and particularly
in our medical colleges, is admittedly burdened
with a bewildering plethora of other branches
of instruction, it is inconceivable that our colleges,
our hospitals and psychiatric institutes, and our
other institutions of higher learning will long continue
to neglect a subject of such vital importance
as psychotherapy and re-education, now that the
subject has been placed, at last, upon a solid basis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
through the application of the psychobiotic and
genetic methods of approach. But it will probably
take considerable time before competent instruction
to fill the need will be available.</p>

<p>It appears therefore highly desirable that an
English version of Dr. Stekel’s works should make
their appearance at this time. For in the absence of
formal instruction his clinical studies form an excellent
substitute, perhaps the most suitable means
available for post-graduate instruction in the clinical
aspects of Psychoanalysis. And should systematic
courses be made available in the near future,
in response to the urgent need, our instructors and
students alike will undoubtedly find the Stekel
series most valuable aids for study and guidance.</p>

<p>In a letter received from Dr. Stekel while this
work was going through the press he states that a
new edition of <i>Onanie und Homosexualität</i> is being
issued in the original, bearing a dedication to the
present translator.</p>

<p>That there are preeminent physicians who
earnestly look upon masturbation as the cause of
homosexuality seems hardly believable. It would
be as proper to consider masturbation the cause of
sexuality. We have shown elsewhere that onanism
may be the result of ungratified homosexual trends.
At times it may stand as a substitute for some
homosexual act. It then replaces for a time the
adequate temporary form of sexual gratification.
I state “temporary form,” because the sexual
object itself does not remain permanently the same
and the sexual directive goals,—to use the excellent
expression of <i>Hans Blüher</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are often abandoned.
The false notion that onanism is responsible for
homosexuality has been preconized by <i>Krafft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>-Ebing</i>,
whose great authority in matters of sexual
psychopathology persists to this day. His services
are significant, indeed, and we must observe that he
has at last accepted the view of <i>Hirschfeld</i> that
homosexuality is inborn,—that there is an acquired
and a hereditary homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But in the last
(14th) edition of <i>Krafft-Ebing’s</i> work, which has
appeared in 1912, his editor, <i>Alfred Fuchs</i>, preserves
the statement about onanism at the head of
the chapter and he even underscores the contentions
of his great teacher on this particular subject.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>My work proves that we must abandon the
merely descriptive method of sexual research. The
subject’s first account is only a statement of the
manifest content of his consciousness concerning
his paraphilia. We must look into the latent content,
into the unconscious and quasi-conscious
forces involved. The descriptive form of sexual research
must be replaced by the psychological, in
keeping with the spirit of our times. In no other
field does analysis so convincingly and completely
prove its claims.</p>

<p>What was the status of the subject before the
advent of analysis? <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> originally looked
upon homosexuality as the result of a hereditary
transmission, a hypothesis not corroborated by the
observations of subsequent investigators. Certain
circumstances favor an outcropping in manifest
form of the latent homosexuality common to all persons,—a
fact which complicates this problem. Environment
also comes into play. An environment
such as is furnished by some nervous or psychopathic
parents naturally plays a role. This subject
we shall take up later. The alleged hereditary
transmission is supposed to show itself in the
homosexual through the early awakening of the
sexual instinct and by the appearance of masturbation
during early childhood. But we know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the homosexuals share this peculiarity with all
others, especially with neurotic persons. A strong
flaring up of instinct is not the consequence but the
cause of the neurosis. But according to <i>Krafft-Ebing</i>
masturbation during childhood is the cause
of homo-or pseudo-homosexuality breaking forth
at a later period. “Nothing is more likely,” he
states, “than masturbation, so to disturb and occasionally
thwart all noble emotions at the source
as they arise spontaneously out of the sexual feeling.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The habit robs the nascent feeling of charm
and beauty leaving behind only the husk of grossly
animal craving for sexual gratification. An individual,
so thwarted, attains the age of maturity
lacking the esthetic, ideal, pure and undefiled longing
which leads to the other sex. At the same time the
heat of sensuous passion cools off while the inclination
towards the other sex is significantly
weakened. This deficiency embraces the morals,
the ethics, the character, the phantasy and the disposition
of the youthful masturbator as well as his
emotional and instinctive life and holds true of both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
sexes, occasionally reducing to zero the yearning
after the opposite sex, so that in the end masturbation
is preferred to every other form of gratification.”</p>

<p>Imagine the injurious effect of such statements
upon the masturbating youth; particularly when
he reads that the best way to combat homosexuality
is to fight against masturbation (p. 336,
<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>The great investigator has confused here cause
and effect. The masturbators avoid the path
leading to woman not because they masturbate.
They indulge in the habit because the path towards
womanhood is closed to them. For many persons
masturbation is the only available method of sexual
gratification. Persons with a strongly accentuated
homosexual tendency often find no other path
open at all, particularly when the intercourse with
woman becomes impossible for them on account of
some definite traumatic incidents, such as we shall
discuss fully later.</p>

<p>Masturbation is never <i>the cause</i> of homosexuality.
Homosexuals do not contract the habit early, as
<i>Krafft-Ebing</i> claims,—it is an early, a very early
habit of all persons—and that without any exception.
The homosexuals do not forget their
childhood onanism because there are other, more
painful memories for them to repress and drive out
of memory. Again we shall speak fully of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
later. More important for the present is the
question: how does homosexuality arise? Is the
condition hereditary or acquired? Is it something
fatally predetermined or is it only the result of
certain definite constellations of the family circle?
May it be ascribed to a hereditary taint? <i>Krafft-Ebing</i>
was at first of the latter opinion and propounded
the thesis that “we may doubt whether a
person of the same sex ever has a sensuous attraction
for a normally predisposed individual,” but
later he changed this opinion fundamentally and
expressed the conviction that there is an inborn
homosexuality though the condition is found only
among the hereditarily predisposed.</p>

<p>He propounded the following theses:</p>

<p>“1. The sexual life of such persons manifests
itself as a rule very precociously and consequently,
is of abnormal strength. Not rarely the peculiar
attraction for members of the same sex which in
itself marks the abnormal direction of the sexual
instinct is associated with other perverse manifestations.</p>

<p>“2. The spiritual love of these persons is frequently
an exalted dreaming just as their sexual
instinct as a whole penetrates their consciousness
with a peculiar and even compulsive strength.</p>

<p>“3. In addition to the functional signs of degeneration
manifested in the contrary sexual instinct
often there are found also other functional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and frequently also anatomic stigmata of degeneration.</p>

<p>“4. Neuroses are present (hysteria, neurasthenia,
epileptoid states, etc.). Neurasthenia,
transitional or chronic, is nearly always manifest.
This is usually a constitutional state induced by
inborn conditions. It is awakened and sustained
through masturbation or compulsory abstinence.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>These statements are relatively milder and here
the ideal traits of homosexuality are also given
some recognition, although—as we know well—all
without exception are addicted to masturbation.
<i>Krafft-Ebing</i> does not know that all artists are
neurotics and that neurosis stands in intimate connection
with creative ability. He also makes a
distinction between true and false homosexuality,—bisexuality
(psychic hermaphroditism) and other
forms, as described by <i>Hirschfeld</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p><i>Krafft-Ebing</i> points out a certain relationship
between homosexuality and neurosis. But since he
still preserves the concept of degeneration, he is
forced in the end to admit that homosexuality may
also appear in the normal and is not necessarily a
morbidity.</p>

<p><i>Moll</i>, to whom we owe the first great comprehensive
work on homosexuality, is of an entirely differ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>ent
opinion. He states: “Considering the sexual
instinct not as a means for the attainment of pleasure
but as standing in the service of procreation we
must look upon exclusive homosexuality as belonging
to the realm of pathology.” (<i>Die kontraere
Sexualempfindung</i>, Berlin, 1899, 3rd edn.)
This is an untenable argument. <i>For there is no
procreative instinct as such, only a sexual instinct.</i>
Science is not concerned with the study of purposiveness,
it is interested in the ascertainment of facts.
Science must not and cannot be placed in the service
of teleology. At any rate <i>Moll</i> is inclined to look
upon homosexuality as a neurosis: he claims to
have found in recent years a growing tendency
among investigators to establish a border province
between mental health and disease, “and into that
realm have been relegated many cases of psychic
degeneration—I may mention, for instance, certain
compulsory neuroses. I believe it is proper that
we should place in the same category the contrary
sexual feeling.” (<i>Loc. cit.</i> p. 435.) He refers here
to <i>Westphal</i> who compares homosexuality to moral
insanity.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding <i>Moll’s</i> opinion we must state
that most modern investigators declare that they
have examined many homosexuals whom they have
found normal or have at least designated as normal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
<i>Havelock Ellis</i> and <i>Albert Moll</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> very appropriately
state in their last joint work:</p>

<p>“<i>Naecke</i> has repeatedly maintained that the
homosexuals are perfectly healthy and aside from
their specific deviation may be normal in every
respect. We have always maintained this view although,
contrary to <i>Naecke</i>, we assume that <i>homosexuality
is very frequently found in intimate association
with minor nervous states</i>. We agree
with <i>Hirschfeld</i> that heredity plays a rôle in no
more than 25 per cent of the cases of homosexuality
and that, although a neuropathic background may
be present in homosexuality, the degenerative factor
plays but a small role.” These authors find the
hypothesis that every person’s constitution combines
the male and female elements a keen concept
though rather hypothetical. “But still it is undoubtedly
justified, if we look upon homosexuality
as an inborn anomaly or, to speak more correctly,
as an anomaly resting on constitutional traits,
which if morbid, are so only in <i>Virchow’s</i> sense, according
to whom pathology is not the science of
diseases but of deviations, so that the homosexual
may be as healthy as the color blind. Inborn
homosexuality ranks on the level of a biologic
variation: it is a variation, representing perhaps
an incomplete phase of sexual differentiation, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
bearing no discernible relationship to any morbid
condition of the individual.”</p>

<p>I am inclined to doubt this view. What proof
have we that the homosexual is perfectly healthy
when any criterion of health we may accept must be
artificial? On this point we have only the statements
of the involved persons to rely upon. All
describe themselves as healthy. Do not advanced
psychopaths do the same? They lack any feeling
of illness. This seems to be characteristic of
homosexuals in particular. They want their condition
to be looked upon as normal. They claim
to be in good health, seldom wish to change their
condition, and usually do not call for medical advice
unless they come into conflict with the law and
find themselves in danger. The authors themselves
very properly remark: “As to the men, the homosexuals
prefer to hold themselves as normal and
endeavor to justify that contention. Those who
struggle against their instinctive craving, who look
upon their conduct as peculiar or so much as entertain
any doubts about it, are in the minority,—less
than 20 per cent.”</p>

<p>Naturally the large number of homosexual physicians
have always tried to convince their observers
that they are normal and that they do not
differ from other persons in any other way. But
all unprejudiced observers have to admit the
presence of numerous neurotic traits in connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
with homosexuality. This I have undertaken to
prove <i>sine ira et studio</i> having met numberless homosexuals
and having become very closely acquainted
with many of them. <i>I have never yet found a
homosexual who was not a neurotic.</i> He is necessarily
that, as I shall later prove. He must be
neurotic, the same as the heterosexual, who
struggles to overcome and repress a vast portion of
homosexual longing with him. <i>Havelock Ellis</i> and
<i>Moll</i> as well as <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> also lay stress upon
the tendency to neurasthenia. But who nowadays
is not neurasthenic? is a question frequently heard.
Such an unprejudiced investigator as <i>Iwan Bloch</i>
becomes convinced and recognizes an inborn homosexuality
which must not be conceived as a morbidity.
For a long time <i>Bloch</i> preconized a different
view but changed his opinion convinced
by <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> work and through his own professional
contact with homosexuals. He is now a believer
in the theory of inborn homosexuality having
been led to this view particularly by the statements
of the homosexuals. Later we shall prove how unreliable
such statements must be. At any rate so
keen an observer as <i>Bloch</i> could not fail to note
the striking percentage of neurotic homosexuals.
But he thought they were nervous because “homosexuality
acts upon them as a psychic trauma.”
Further he states: “According to my investigations
and observations the <i>relationship between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
health and disease among homosexuals is originally
the same as among heterosexuals</i> and in time, on account
of the social and individual isolation of the
homosexuals, acting like a psychic trauma, morbidity
becomes accentuated; usually we encounter
nervous complaints and difficulties of an acquired
character, and we note the development of a typical
‘homosexual neurasthenia,’ which may readily
enough lead some superficial observers to confuse
<i>post hoc</i> with <i>propter hoc</i>.” Undoubtedly the
dangers of homosexual activity favor the development
of anxiety states. But such nervous states
are found also in cases showing no predisposition
towards anxiety, and anxiety states are encountered
without any relation to homosexuality.</p>

<p><i>Magnus Hirschfeld</i> places himself with all the
weight of his personality and experience squarely in
favor of the contention that homosexuality is a
normal state. His investigations touching upon
this field are numerous. We also owe to his labors
that great work on the subject: <i>Die Homosexualitaet
des Mannes und des Weibes</i>. (The Homosexuality
of Man and of Woman, Verlag L. Marcus,
Berlin, SW, 61.) No investigator interested in
this subject can neglect this fundamental and exhaustive
treatment of it. Subsuming the views of
<i>Hirschfeld</i> we may state: There is a genuine inborn
homosexuality which must not be looked upon as
a morbidity. This homosexuality should be con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>fused
neither with bisexuality nor with pseudo-homosexuality.
<i>Hirschfeld</i>, too, has changed his
views in the course of time. He had conceived
homosexuality as a sexual intermediary stage between
man and woman and proposed the famous
term: <i>the third sex</i>. As is well known all persons
are bisexual. <i>Hirschfeld</i> looked for the well known
physical stigmata of bisexuality among the homosexuals.
He found among men enlargement of the
breasts, female hips, delicate skin, etc., and among
women growth of facial hair, male, energetic traits,
etc. In his work entitled, <i>Der Urnische Mensch</i>, he
maintained: “A homosexual not differing bodily,
physically and mentally from the full grown man I
have not found among 1500 subjects and I am
therefore disposed to doubt the occurrence until I
shall meet such an individual.” But in his more
recent work he declares: “The androgynic type of
man and the gynandric type of woman are not necessarily
homosexual. There are types of persons
which may be described as eunuchoid,—they give
the impression of castrated persons without having
undergone the operation,—they possess female
bodies, high voice and beardless face. Generally
there is azoospermia, frequently anorchia. There
are corresponding types in the female sex,—persons
with bodies showing many masculine traits. These
marked womanly men and mannish women are often
considered homosexual, but it is not uncommon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
find them completely heterosexual inasmuch as they
find complementary individuals among the types belonging
to the opposite sex. The types which attract
them are also androgynous.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><i>Hirschfeld</i> does not admit the influence of latent
homosexuality in the choice of this androgenic type.
A homosexual whose condition is not manifest he
does not recognize. His ground for diagnosis is no
longer similarity of bodily traits when compared
with the opposite sex. The determining factor for
<i>Hirschfeld</i> is only the subject’s feeling. <i>If he is
homosexually inclined (particularly if so disposed
from childhood), the subject is homosexual.</i>
<i>Hirschfeld’s</i> own statement is as follows: “The determining
factor in the diagnosis of homosexuality
remains as before the contrary feeling proper; the
diagnosis is strongly supported by a negative attitude
towards the other sex, as well as by altero-sexual
episodes, although these two features in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
themselves are not capable of establishing the
diagnosis.” Since <i>Bloch</i> also admits that there
are many virile homosexuals with bodily structures
wholly male, it follows that the organic diagnosis
of homosexuality is altogether unreliable. <i>Hans
Blüher</i>, a reliable expert on homosexuality, also
recognizes the pure homosexual, which he calls the
“male hero” type, whose character and habitus is
completely male, thus differing from the second
type, the “woman-like invert” (<i>invertierter Weibling</i>).
The latent homosexual he considers a third
type. (Vid. <i>Die drei Grundformen der Homosexualitaet:
Eine sexuologische Studie.</i> Jahrbuch
f. sexuelle Zwischenstuffen, vol. XIII).</p>

<p>Let us repeat and underscore the far-fetched
feature of this method of diagnosis. According to
it <i>there is no objective means for ascertaining
homosexuality. The only diagnostic guide is the
homosexual’s declaration that he has always felt
homosexually inclined and that he is indifferent towards
the other sex.</i></p>

<p>The analyst is well qualified to recognise the
utter weakness of such a diagnostic guide. We
meet continually persons who claim to know themselves
thoroughly; they claim that they have investigated
their own state very conscientiously but
after a few weeks, often only after a few days (illustrations
will be fully given in this book) the
subject must admit that he did not know himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that, in fact, he had avoided knowing himself. <i>All
persons lie about sexual matters and deceive themselves
in the first place.</i> All play <i>Vogel-strauss-politik</i>,
the ostrich.</p>

<p><i>All neurotics falsify their life history or at least
retouch it.</i> They simply forget the facts which do
not suit their system of thinking. We must also
bear in mind <i>Havelock Ellis’</i> statement that the
homosexuals prefer to consider themselves as
normal. Similarly the childhood history is distorted
consciously or unconsciously and a life history
is reconstructed (in retrospect) from which all
heterosexual episodes have been eliminated.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis has proven that all homosexuals,
without exception, show heterosexual tendencies
in early life. There is no exception to this rule.
<i>There are no monosexual persons!</i> The heterosexual
period stretches far into puberty. <i>All persons
are bisexual.</i> But persons repress either the
homosexual or the heterosexual components on account
of certain motives or because they are compelled
by particular circumstances and consequently
act as if they were monosexual. Even the
“male hero” (<i>Maennerheld</i>) type and <i>Hirschfeld’s</i>
“genuine” homosexual is only apparently monosexual.
A glance through the confessions disclosed
by all writers is enough to convince one of
this fact. <i>Hirschfeld</i> himself points out that it is
to the credit of psychoanalysis that it has revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the transitory heterosexual cravings of the homosexual.</p>

<p><i>The instinct of the homosexual originally is not
exclusively directed towards the same sex. Originally
the homosexual is also bisexual.</i> But he represses
his heterosexuality just as the heterosexual
must repress his homosexuality. <i>Blüher</i> who is unwilling
to recognise a pathogenesis of homosexuality
for the ‘male hero’ type, contends that one could
claim with equal relevance that there is a pathogenesis
of heterosexuality.</p>

<p>That is a fact. Every monosexuality is other
than normal or natural. <i>Nature has created us bisexual
beings and requires us to act as bisexual
beings.</i> The purely heterosexual is always a neurotic
in a certain sense, that is, the repression of
the homosexual components already creates a predisposition
to neurosis, or is in itself a neurotic
trait shared by every normal person. The psychology
of paranoia, for whose investigation we are
indebted to the genius of <i>Freud</i>, shows us the extreme
result of this process of repression on one
side, just as homosexuality shows us the other side
of the same process.</p>

<p>There is no homosexual who is not more or less
neurotic, that condition being due to the repression
of the heterosexuality. The repression is a purely
psychic process and has nothing to do with degeneration.
Homosexuality is not a product of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
degeneration in the ordinary sense. It is a neurosis
and displays the etiology of a neurosis, as we
shall prove later.</p>

<p>I revert to <i>Hirschfeld</i>. Regarding the relationship
of neurosis and homosexuality he states:</p>

<p>“1. Pronounced physical and mental stigmata of
degeneration are relatively rare among homosexual
men and women; at any rate such signs are not
more frequent in proportion to the total number of
homosexuals than among the heterosexuals of both
sexes.</p>

<p>“2. On the other hand we find frequently and
not merely as a result of homosexuality, <i>a greater
instability of the nervous system</i> (frequently shown
in the periodic character of endogenous temperamental
instability) (<i>endogene Stimmungsschwankungen</i>).</p>

<p>“3. The family of the homosexual often contains
a larger number of nervous persons and such as
deviate from the normal sexual type. (<i>Hirschfeld</i>,
<i>l.c.</i>, <i>p.</i> 338).</p>

<p><i>Hirschfeld</i> also emphasizes the labile character of
the nervous system among homosexuals pointing to
the large number of abnormal sexual types in the
family of the homosexual. That undoubtedly is a
correct observation. It may be explained in two
ways: (1) as the result of heredity; (2) as a consequence
of a common environment. The extent to
which these two factors are at work in particular in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>stances
may be ascertained only on the basis of
specific inquiries.</p>

<p>I can state from my own professional experience
that the parents of homosexuals always show abnormal
character traits. With remarkable frequency
male homosexuals have mothers who are
melancholic, or subject to depressions or who are
advanced hystericals. All gradations are found,
from the emotional, domineering type of woman to
the solitary, quiet, submissive woman who becomes
a prey to melancholia and eventually must be interned
in some institution. Urlinds show just as
frequently a pathologic father, a home tyrant, a
drinker, morphine fiend, dissolute fellow, ‘lady killer,’
epileptic or hysterical. We will determine
later to what extent such parents influence psychically
their offspring and the attitude of the children
towards them. Careful investigation of life
histories will make the subject plain.</p>

<p>How do the various writers explain the rise of
homosexuality? We have mentioned already that
<i>Hirschfeld</i> and all investigators deriving their inspiration
from him hold to the theory that homosexuality
is inborn. According to them, therefore,
it is part of inexorable fate, like the law of the
planets....</p>

<p>But <i>Bloch</i> finds the condition baffling in spite of
all the explanations furnished by <i>Hirschfeld</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
reverting to the latter’s chemical theory (<i>andrin</i>
and <i>gynecin</i>) he concludes:</p>

<p>“(1) The so-called ‘undifferentiated’ stage of
the sexual instinct (<i>Max Dessoir</i>) is often eliminated
when the sexual instinct becomes directed towards
a definite particular sex among heterosexuals
or homosexuals before the advent of puberty.
Homosexuality shows a definite, clear direction of
the sexual instinct towards the same sex long before
puberty.</p>

<p>“2. A comprehensive theory of homosexuality
must also explain the extreme cases, particularly
male homosexuality coupled with complete virility.</p>

<p>“3. Sexual parts and genital glands cannot determine
homosexuality in those possessing typical
normal male genitalia and testicles; neither can
the brain itself be the determining factor in genuine
homosexuality, because homosexuality cannot
be rooted out by the strongest conscious and unconscious
heterosexual influences brought to bear
upon thought and phantasy,—the condition developing
in spite of such influences.</p>

<p>“4. Since as a predisposition (not as sexual instinct)
homosexuality appears long before puberty
and before the actual functioning of the respective
genital glands, it suggests that in homosexuals some
physiologic action pertaining to ‘sexuality’ but not
necessarily related to the functioning of the genital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
glands undergoes some subtle change as the result
of which the sexual instinct is turned from its goal.</p>

<p>“5. The condition suggests chemical changes,
alterations in the chemism of sexual tension, the
latter being fairly independent of the activity of
the sexual glands proper, as is shown by the fact
that it may be preserved among eunuchs and others
who undergo castration.” (<i>Bloch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 589).</p>

<p>Further he states: “In my opinion the anatomic
contradiction, the biologic monstrosity of a womanly,
or unmanly psyche in a typical male body or a
womanly-unmanly sexual psyche in the presence of
normally appearing and functioning male genitalia
can be solved only if we take into consideration this
intercurrent third factor. The latter may be
traceable to some embryonal disturbance in the
sexual chemism. That would also explain why
homosexuality often appears in the midst of
healthy families as a singular manifestation, having
no relation to any possible hereditary transmission
or degenerative taint. On the other hand, the contention
of <i>v. Roemer</i> that homosexuality is a regenerative
process has hardly any points to support
it. The root of the riddle of homosexuality
lies here. At least I conceive it to be a riddle.
With my theory I endeavor to cover merely the
facts and the probable physiologic relationship of
homosexuality with particular reference to the biologic
aspect of the problem and to do it more closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
than the previous theories have done it. But my
theory does not attempt to explain the ultimate origin
of the relatively frequent condition known as
homosexuality.</p>

<p>“I do not claim to be able to penetrate into the
last ultimate causes. This remains a riddle to be
solved. But from the standpoint of culture and
procreation homosexuality appears to be a meaningless
and purposeless dysteleological manifestation,
like many another natural appearance, such
as, for instance, the vermiform appendix in man. In
a former chapter I have already pointed out that
the progress of culture has been in the direction of
a sharper differentiation of sexes, that the antithesis
male and female, becomes progressively
sharper. Sexual indifference, genital transition-forms
are of primitive character and <i>Eduard v.
Mayer</i> is correct when he holds that homosexuality
was much more widespread during the prehistoric
age than it is today and considers it as common,
genetically, as heterosexual love. Through
heredity, adjustment and differentiation, culture
has progressively repressed the homosexual leanings.”
(<i>Bloch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 590.)</p>

<p>Concerning these novel theories of homosexuality
I must remark: <i>It is not correct that the homosexuals
before puberty show an exclusive definite inclination
towards their own sex and only towards
their own.</i> The truth is that like all other persons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the homosexuals show a bisexual period (the undifferentiated
stage of <i>Max Dessoir</i>) before puberty.
Only they forget their heterosexual experiences.
The truth is that a comprehensive theory of homosexuality
ought to explain also the extreme cases,
specifically male homosexuality coupled with
complete preservation of vitality and female homosexuality
with the preservation of all feminine characters.
Such cases are covered neither by <i>Hirschfeld’s</i>
theory nor by that of <i>Bloch</i>. The third point
is equally pertinent. It cannot be a question of
brain and genital gland. Chemical influences are
likely, but difficult to prove.</p>

<p>The baffling feature of the problem is due to the
fact that the attempt has been made to explain all
cases of homosexuality on the basis of a single plan.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact homosexuality may develop
in a number of ways and each one must be taken into
consideration. That the genital glands play a
role in homosexuality seems to me very likely. But
while these influences may be suspected they cannot
be proven. What I am able to prove on the basis
of my data are the psychic factors.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that not only does the body
influence the mind, but that the reverse is also true:
the psyche builds up the body in accordance with
its predispositions. We find that the artist’s
physiognomy differs from that of the artisan, and
the physician’s differs from that of the attorney.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
The mind also models the body. A man who feels
himself woman-like and who longs to be a woman
will unconsciously adopt woman’s ways and imitate
woman. In the course of time even his appearance
will be womanly. Possibly—that agrees with my
view—the transformation is conditioned by glandular
changes. We may presuppose that, but the
notion appertains to the realm of hypothesis, which
I prefer to avoid.</p>

<p>All writers seem to neglect the powerful role of
the psychic factors. These factors may seem unreal
to the upholder of mechanistic theories. Unfortunately
most physicians underestimate the
power of the unconscious wish as a plastic and synthesising
energy within the human organism. The
wish to be a man may raise boys to manliness; the
wish to remain a child hinders development towards
adulthood; the wish to be a woman makes for
femininity. Any one familiar with <i>Pawlow’s</i> investigations
of the ‘conditioned reflex’ will readily
see that certain particular wishes may exert a definite
influence upon the activity of the genital glands.
The wishes are certainly capable of influencing the
appearance, action, activity and features of the individual.</p>

<p>When a boy acts like a girl, it does not necessarily
mean that he has that kind of a predisposition.
It may only signify his identification with
his mother or with a sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Very clearly on this point is the testimony of a
case of which I find an account in <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> book.</p>

<p>A homosexual woman writes: “I was born in the
country, where my father owned a large estate, and
there I was brought up till my 14th year. I was
the youngest. My oldest brother had girlish ways
about him and was mother’s pet rather than
father’s, whose favorite child, in turn, was my
eldest sister. On my part I am the thorough image
of my father in all character traits and in my sensuous
predisposition as well. In later years father
had often said: ‘With you and Ludwig (the elder
brother) nature made a mistake; you should have
been a boy and Ludwig a girl.’ Nevertheless I am
certain that father knew nothing about homosexuality,
also that my brother was not homosexual.
My peculiar predisposition showed itself already
while I was a child, for it was always my greatest
desire to be a boy. As a child two or three years
of age, I put on some of father’s clothes, played
with his cap and promenaded around the yard with
his walking stick.” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 43).</p>

<p>We see clearly that this young woman identified
herself with her father. She wanted to be a man
like her father.</p>

<p>The remarks of <i>Ulrichs</i> (<i>vid. Inclusa</i>, p. 27 ffl.)
may be understood in the same sense: “As a child
the urning shows an unmistakable predisposition
towards girlish occupations, intercourse with girls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
girlish games, and playing with dolls. Such a
child is very sorry that it is not ‘boy-like’ to play
with dolls, that Santa Claus does not bring him also
dolls and that he is not allowed to play with his
sister’s dolls. Such a child shows interest in sewing,
knitting and cutting, in the soft and delicate
texture of girls’ clothes, such as he, too, would like
to wear, and in the colored silks and ribbons of
which he delights to abstract some specimens as
keepsakes. He avoids contact with boys, he avoids
their plays and games. The play horse leaves him
indifferent. Soldier games, so much in favor with
boys do not attract him. He avoids all boyish
rough plays, such as snow-balling. He likes ordinary
ball games but only with girls. He throws
the ball with the girl’s light and stilted arm movement
not with a boy’s free and powerful arm swing.
Any one who has occasion to observe a boy urning
and does it carefully may verify these or similar
peculiarities. Is that all only imagination? I
had observed in myself long ago the peculiarities
mentioned above and, moreover, they always impressed
me, although I did not at first recognize
their female character. In 1854 I related the facts
to a relative of mine, intimating that they must
have some bearing on my sexuality. He scorned
the idea and I yielded to his opinion at the time.
But in 1862 I took up that matter again with him:
meanwhile I had had opportunity to observe other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
urnings and I noted that the female <i>habitus</i> recurred
in every one, although not precisely with the
same particular features. But the female <i>habitus</i>
differs also among women with regard to certain details.
In my case, as a boy of 10 or 12 years of
age, how often my dear mother sighed as she exclaimed:
‘Karl, you are not like other boys.’ How
often she warned me: ‘You will grow up a queer
fellow, if nothing worse!’” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>, <i>l. c.</i> p.
117).</p>

<p>What do these fine observations prove? Any
one who understands the playful character of
children, their early directed psyche, must recognise
that such conduct results through the influence
of a wish.</p>

<p>No—these observations do not prove at all that
the contrary sexual feeling is innate. <i>Hirschfeld</i>
contends: “these accounts (referring to previous
statements) show a remarkable absence of tenderness
among the urning girls. An expert thoroughly
familiar with their psyche, not without reason
states that we must watch the girl who passes
carelessly by a looking glass without stopping in
front of it when dressing and we must watch the
boy who clings with pleasure to the looking glass
returning to it again and again, for thereby both
betray early their homosexual nature.” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>,
<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 119). I see nothing in these state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>ments
but an attempt on his part to differ from the
other colleagues.</p>

<p>Finally I turn to my own conception of homosexuality,
formulated, on the basis of psychoanalytic
data and as an outgrowth of the teachings
of <i>Freud</i>.</p>

<p><i>All persons originally are bisexual in their predisposition.
There is no exception to this rule.
Normal persons show a distinct bisexual period up
to the age of puberty. The heterosexual then represses
his homosexuality. He also sublimates a
portion of his homosexual cravings in friendship,
nationalism, social endeavors, gatherings, etc. If
this sublimation fails him he becomes neurotic.
Since no person overcomes completely his homosexual
tendencies, every one carries within himself the
predisposition to neurosis. The stronger the repression,
the stronger is also the neurotic reaction
which may be powerful enough in its extreme form to
lead to paranoia</i> (Freud’s theory of paranoia). <i>If
the heterosexuality is repressed, homosexuality comes
to the forefront. In the case of the homosexual the
repressed and incompletely conquered heterosexuality
furnishes the disposition towards neurosis. The
more thoroughly his heterosexuality is sublimated the
more completely the homosexual presents the picture
of a normal healthy person. He then resembles
the normal heterosexual. But like the normal hetero</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span><i>sexual
individual, even the “male hero” type displays
a permanent latent disposition to neurosis.</i></p>

<p><i>The process of sublimation is more difficult in the
case of the normal homosexual than in the case of
the normal heterosexual. That is why this type is
extremely rare and why a thorough analysis always
discloses typical neurotic reactions. The neurotic
reactions of repression</i> (Abwehr, Freud) <i>are anxiety,
shame, disgust and hatred (or scorn). The heterosexual
is inspired with disgust at any homosexual
acts. That proves his affectively determined negative
attitude. For disgust is but the obverse of attraction.
The homosexual manifests the same feeling
of disgust for woman, showing him to be a neurotic.
(Or else he hates woman.) For the normal
homosexual—if there be such a type—would be indifferent
towards woman. These generalisations already
show that the healthy person must act as a
bisexual being.</i></p>

<p>We know only one race of people who recognised
formally the bisexual nature of man: the Greeks.
But we must recognise also that the Greeks had attained
the highest level of physical and cultural development.
We shall have to inquire into the reasons
why homosexuality fell into such disrepute and why
the example of the Greeks found no imitation among
the moderns, despite the recognition accorded the
tremendous cultural achievements of the ancient
Greeks. That will be done later. We conclude:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
<i>There is no inborn homosexuality and no inborn
heterosexuality. There is only bisexuality.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Monosexuality
already involves a predisposition to neurosis,
in many cases stands for the neurosis proper.</i></p>

<p>The theory is not a novel one. New is only its
association with neurosis. The merit to have been
the first to express it belongs to <i>Kiernan</i> (<i>Medical
Standard</i>, 1888). <i>Kiernan</i> started with the fact
that all lower animals are bisexual and conceived
homosexuality as a retrogression to the primitive
hermaphroditic form of animal existence. We must
note this theory as we shall have occasion to revert
to it when discussing the predisposition to neurosis.
<i>Chevalier</i> (<i>Inversion Sexuelle</i>, 1893) also
begins his inquiry with a consideration of the
aboriginal bisexuality of the fœtus. Two other investigators
may be mentioned in this connection:
<i>Lombroso</i>, to whom belongs the credit of having
called attention to the manifestations of retrogression
(<i>atavism</i>) and <i>Binet</i>, who maintains that homosexuality
arises when the aboriginal undifferentiated
sexual instinct (consequently the bisexual instinct)
is aroused through some early experience in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
association with a person of the same sex. Here
we have an adumbration of the theory of infantile
trauma which plays such a tremendous role in
<i>Freud’s</i> work. In the following chapters a number
of cases will be recorded clearly illustrating
the latent influence of infantile experiences.</p>

<p>But we must guard against assuming as true all
the traumas which are reported to us. Some of the
incidents are interpolated into the life history and
only subsequently assume significance. But nothing
is so dangerous in psychology as one-sidedness.
The etiology of homosexuality is a particularly
fruitful field in which to prove, here and there, the
role of infantile traumatic experiences. <i>Krafft-Ebing</i>
holds that <i>Binet’s</i> theory will not stand close
critical analysis but expresses himself very unfavorably
regarding the importance of psychologic relations
as a whole. He states: “Psychic forces are
not sufficient to explain so serious a degenerative
process.” This depreciation of psychic influences
was not very surprising at a time when the prevalent
tendency was to explain nearly everything
through heredity or taint.</p>

<p>Before attempting to give an exposition of the
psychologic theory of homosexuality I must discuss
the relations between homosexuality and neurosis.
All investigators, we have already seen, agree that
a relationship exists between them. The question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
is: does the homosexual become neurotic because he
fears coming into conflict with the penal laws, because
he feels his unfortunate predisposition is
something contrary to nature (to adopt his own
expression),—briefly because he is homosexual, or
is he homosexual because he is neurotic?</p>

<p>Here we naturally encounter the need of defining
the meaning of neurosis. What is neurosis and
who is neurotic? I call neurotic the person who
has not successfully overcome the asocial cravings
which he perceives to be unethical. I call asocial
cravings all instincts which society rejects as conflicting
with its cultural demands. That in itself
shows that the essence of neurosis must differ in
different countries. In one instance we find repression
of normal sexuality, because sexual
activity itself is considered unmoral. (Example: the
properly brought up girl in good society who must
remain coy.) In another, we find a struggle with
instincts which society decrees as morbid. (Example:
the actress who maintains many friendships
and must suppress her homosexual longings.) In
the same way criminal tendencies may play a role
in the development of a neurosis. The neurosis is
the result of the struggle between instinct and inhibition.
There are, therefore, two paths for the
development of the neurosis: a strong instinctive
craving which naturally endeavors to break through
the inhibitions and powerful inhibitions which re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>duce
to a minimum the voicing of sexual needs even
under the impulsion of strong instincts.</p>

<p>The predisposition to neurosis, therefore, is intimately
linked with our instincts. The progression
of the human race requires the frequent suppression
of certain instincts and every step in ethical and
cultural progress involves giving up some portion
of instinctive cravings. The laws are a protection
of society against the instinctive cravings of its
members. Society tolerates but a portion of the
instincts to a certain extent and all others it outlaws
as asocial. The evolution of the race may
eventually reach a stage wherein the instincts will
have been placed altogether at the service of
society: the domestication of the instinctive cravings.
This is the meaning of the struggle of centuries
between brain and spinal cord. The results
of this struggle may be determined only if we
contrast a truly aboriginal man with a typical
representative of culture. What remarkable progress
has been attained in the conquest of instinct!
Society goes a step further. It takes care that individuals
possessing asocial instincts should be unable
to propagate their kind. Criminals are rendered
innocuous, the asocial person finds the environment
unfavorable and disappears.</p>

<p>But—as I have already stated in my book, <i>Die
Träume der Dichter</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>—the creative urge of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
does not mollify man’s asocial requirements. The
struggle between nature and culture keeps up unabated
and the result is neurosis. All paraphilias
are a compromise between instinct and repression.</p>

<p>I must revert here to my theory of neurosis which
I have expressed first in my work entitled, <i>Die
Träume der Dichter</i>.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The neurotic is a retrograded
type. He represents a conquered stage of
human evolution. He must personally undergo the
struggle through which the human race as a whole
has already passed. The ontogenesis of culture!
Whenever nature attempts the creation of something
great, powerful or sublime it turns to the
great reservoir of its past. Recessive types manifest
more powerful instincts. The neurotic, criminals
and the specially gifted persons have that in
common. Three paths are open to the man with
heightened instincts: he sublimates his selfish tendencies,
his criminal cravings, his asocial attitude
derived from previous epochs and becomes a creator
(poet, painter, sculptor, musician, prophet, inventor,
etc.); he works out his instincts untrammelled
and becomes a criminal; or the sublimation is but
partly successful and he becomes a neurotic.</p>

<p>My theory of homosexuality thus links itself to
the view of <i>Lombroso</i>. The homosexual, in the first
place, is a recessive character. He shows a precocious
development of an instinct which does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
fit the requirements of culture; but biologically he
stands nearer the aboriginal bisexual predisposition
of mankind than the normal person who is typical
of the current age. This conflict manifests itself
in various over-compensations, so that the neurotic
advances beyond his age and becomes a creator of
the future. I must ask my readers to consult my
works quoted above for further details on this subject.
I have here merely stated in brief what may
have a bearing on our present theme.</p>

<p>The specially gifted, the artist, the criminal and
the neurotic manifest the same characteristic: over-stressing
of instinctive cravings. The criminal
carries out his promptings, the artist sublimates
them in his works (<i>Shakespeare</i> conceived so many
murders and that saved him from becoming a
murderer ... states <i>Hebbel</i>) while the neurotic
meets in them his unsolvable conflicts. He is the
criminal without the criminal’s courage to commit
asocial deeds. He is the Don Juan of phantasy,
the Marquis de Sade of his own day dreams, the
Jack the Ripper, without knowing it.</p>

<p>These considerations justify the assumption that
poets, artists and neurotics must show a precocious
development of the instinctive cravings, particularly
of the sexual. That is in fact the case. With
regard to artists this is well known,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the fact has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
been repeatedly mentioned as typical of criminals
and with regard to neurotics the analysts have been
able to prove it again and again.</p>

<p>We may now appreciate why all investigators
found that the sexual instinct awakens early in all
homosexuals. I want to make myself clear. We
owe to psychoanalysis the recognition of the fact
that the sexual instinct awakens early in all persons,—a
fact I have pointed out already during my pre-Freudian
period in my essay on “<i>Coitus during
Childhood</i>.” But most persons repress their infantile
memories and later recall nothing about these
occurrences dating from their childhood. The
homosexual remembers everything and that fact is
pointed out as proof of his sexual precocity. Already
as a child he knew that certain things pertain
to the forbidden realm of the sexual. He repressed
from memory numberless particular incidents
among the vast number his memory could hold.
The fact of his precocity, he does not forget. But
at the same time all memories which do not happen
to fit into his system of ideas are either bedimmed
in consciousness or lost from memory altogether.
Sexual precocity is a fact brought out in all life
histories and confessions of homosexuals. And that
very sexual precocity shows us that the conditions
which lead to the repression of heterosexuality, are
traceable far back into the past and stretch well
beyond ordinary memory recall. Therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
<i>Krafft-Ebing</i> finds: “The sexual life of persons of
this type is usually manifest very early and is abnormally
strong. Not infrequently it is associated
with other perverse manifestations, in addition to
the perverted direction of the sexual instinct peculiar
to this type of sexual feeling.”</p>

<p>Further in the same work: “There are neuroses
present (hysteria, neurasthenia, epileptoid states,
etc.). Nearly always there is also present either
temporary or permanent neurasthenia.” (P. 259.)</p>

<p>We see now that the two statements correspond.
The individual becomes neurotic because he is unable
to overcome the abnormally strong instincts.
Epilepsy as well as grand hysteria serve as means
for releasing the abnormally stressed instincts during
slumber states.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It would appear therefore
that a certain relationship must exist between homosexuality
and epilepsy; in fact we shall take the opportunity
later to report in full a case illustrating
that relationship.</p>

<p>These instincts involve not only homosexual and
heterosexual cravings. They include also sadistic
tendencies and mysophilia, koprophilia, necrophilia
and particularly the linking of sexual and criminal
tendencies. Neurosis represents them under grotesque
changes, attenuations, transformations, substitutions
and exaggerations, all having counterpart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
in the homosexual neurosis. The relations between
homosexuality and sadism are particularly interesting
and will be considered fully in the following
pages.</p>

<p>We may formulate our notion of the development
of homosexuality as follows: <i>A person with abnormally
strong instinctive cravings is induced early in
life to surround these cravings with inhibitions.
The early awakening of his sexual instinct and its
precocious functioning bring him into conflict. The
processes of repression and of sublimation set in to
deal with these cravings much earlier than in other
persons. For one reason or another the heterosexual
components are repressed and the homosexual are
evolved. The heterosexual cravings are hemmed in
and rendered useless by disgust, hatred or fear.</i></p>

<p>Homosexuality arises out of bisexuality as a result
of certain particular attitudes which become determined
very early in life. But not always. Such
traits may appear also relatively late in life. Why
and under what conditions does that happen? In
the chapters next following we propose to take up
this problem.</p>

<p>Freud who supports the theory of bisexuality
with all the weight of his authority, points out that
hitherto we have entertained wrong notions concerning
the nature of the relations between sexual
instinct and sexual goal. The sexual instinct is
at first independent of its object and owes not its
origin to the excitations roused by the sexual object.
The earliest stage of man he has designated
as autoerotic and he has described for us the infantile
form of onanism.</p>

<p>The development of sexuality may be conceived,
broadly, as follows: the first stage is autoerotic, although
all-erotic stimuli are also present (suckling
at the mother’s breast, caressing of the infant, etc.).
The child is more sensitive to all forms of excitation
and all vegetative functions are surcharged
with pleasurable feelings more strongly in him than
in the adult. Sexual life is autoerotic, but it is bi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>sexually
autoerotic. The child makes no distinction
between the persons to whom it is attached.
Young or old, male or female,—it is all alike to
him. But autoerotism is characteristic of this sexual
life. Gradually this feature is overshadowed
by the appearance of the all-erotic tendency. At
first the child seeks to find the goal for its sexuality
among the possible objects of his limited surroundings.
Just as the first period of autoerotism is
overcome so the normal fixation upon one’s family
must be eventually outgrown. (Thou shalt leave
thy father and thy mother and follow thine husband!)
But even during the earliest period all
libidinous excitations are distinctly bisexual. This
bisexuality persists until the period of puberty,
that is, throughout that stage of sexual indifference,
of which <i>Desoir</i> also speaks. But the tendency to bisexuality
is unable to withstand the powerful stress
of puberty. The girlish boy becomes a man, the tomboy
girl becomes a young woman. The development
of the secondary sexual characters displace
man’s heterosexual characteristics with the stamp
of monosexuality. Usually at this time there develops
also a decisive struggle against homosexuality
leading, sooner or later, to the complete suppression
of that tendency. (Naturally there are exceptions,
as some persons retain their bisexual
character traits without trouble throughout life.)
<i>I have not examined a person thus far in whom I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
failed to recognise clearly the signs of juvenile
homosexuality.</i></p>

<p>It is proper to hold that the neurotics show themselves
functionally bisexual. Among the neurotics
the males often have little or no beard growth,
plump and roundish bodily figure, high voice and
soft facial features, especially nose and lips; they
have small hands, small feet, their penis is remarkably
small, scant hairy growth upon their mons
veneris, cryptorchism (undescended testicle), hernias.
On the other hand neurotic women show
hairy growth on face, flat chest, strong, male
figure—more angular than is characteristic of
women,—large, full hands, large feet, disorders of
menstruation including amenorrhea (complete suppression),
infantile uterus, male larynx and deep
voice. I do not maintain that this is invariably
the case. Now and then I have met with exceptions;
but I believe that a thorough investigation
would support this contention.</p>

<p>The tendency to neurosis is due to the strong instinctive
cravings which manifest themselves bisexually.</p>

<p>There is a process at work which I am inclined to
designate as the fundamental law of sex. According
to this law every individual tends to sum up all
his instinctive sexual cravings in one image. Every
person seeks the sexual ideal capable of satisfying
all his sexual longings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>The sexual ideal of the ancients was, clearly, a
bisexual being. Divinity is the ideal erotic goal
magnified. The first divinities were always bisexual.
They were either women with a penis or
men with a female breast. The longing for the bisexual
ideal may be traced throughout humanity.
In his Banquet, <i>Plato</i> has excellently expressed this
longing in the well-known words of <i>Aristophanes</i>.</p>

<p>We feel that we are utilizing but a portion of our
sexual energy and that the remainder is allowed to
remain fallow. The various sexual trends are
sometimes so split up in life that no part of them
is sufficient alone to furnish the whole driving
power for the proper sexual activity. This is the
case with those who apparently manifest a diminished
sexual craving, as <i>Freud</i> and <i>Havelock
Ellis</i> have observed with reference to certain homosexuals.
This condition is only apparent, however,
and analysis discloses that it is not real.
Persons of this type, apparently asexual, really vacillate
back and forth between various possible
sexual goals never reaching the stage of aggression,
because they are incapable of attaining a sufficient
summation of sexual libido. Their libido splits up
into a number of autoerotic acts, through which
the fore-pleasure instead of centering on a focus is
expended in small instalments, as I have pointed
out when I described the various forms of cryptic
onanism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>I repeat: the ideal of every person is to be able
to concentrate all libido upon a single goal. That
explains why the homosexual does not seek the
typical male, except in the rarest instances. <i>Freud</i>
has drawn our attention to this apparent contrast.
Many homosexuals, particularly those who, themselves,
possess strong virility, do not seek out the
complete male for their ideal, but the womanly male.
They prefer the female type of man, men in female
clothes, or of female habitus,—a fact which has
shaped a great deal the course of male prostitution.
The male prostitute endeavors always to
imitate the female through the use of trinkets, corset,
the adoption of articles of female apparel, close
shaving, peculiar gait and speech.</p>

<p>What the homosexual seeks consciously the latent
homosexual, as we designate the neurotic and, in
smaller measure, every individual who acts exclusively
as a heterosexual, endeavors to attain through
vague yearnings which he fails to understand but
which are strong enough to break through.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to these hidden
forms of sexuality, before attempting to explain the
rise of the manifest and of the overt forms of homosexuality.
Among the latent homosexuals who
struggle with all the problems of bisexuality which to
them appear unsolvable and inscrutable, and who
have recourse to various compromises which bring
them some temporary relief, we may find the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
transitional stages leading all the way up to the
overt forms of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Latent homosexuality is a fact, not uncovered by
analysis, but analysis has tremendously enlarged
our understanding of the mental processes involved.
The deeper we penetrate into the psychic mechanism
of the neuroses and psychoses, the more vital
appears to us the role of homosexuality. The difference
between my method of analysis and the
customary anamnesis is shown nowhere so clearly,
as in connection with the disclosures of the neurotics
regarding their hidden homosexuality. No other
component of the sexual instinct undergoes repression
to such an extent or shifts so far from the
sphere of ordinary consciousness. I know persons
who have frankly adopted a great many forms of
paraphilia but have completely repressed the homosexual
component of their condition. I have analysed,
for instance, a young woman who had quite
an eventful life history. She became neurotic because
she could neither master nor suppress her
homosexuality. Like all other neurotics she skilfully
covered her homosexuality and this trait of
hers remained unknown to her consciousness.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to the beginner, therefore, to
know the various disguises which serve as masks for
homosexuality. As is well known, all neurotic symptoms
are the results of compromise and they cover,
on the one hand, as much as they disclose, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
other. The tendency to adopt compromises, which is
typical of the split personality, is a subject worthy
of special consideration. The most antagonistic
impulses are stressed and summed up under the same
symptom. This tendency to adopt compromises
governs the mental life of the neurotic. It is seen
in dreams as well as in political life, in artistic products
no less than in neurotic symptoms. If the need
to adjust opposing tendencies under some compromise
is not met successfully a condition of uncertainty
arises,—of vacillation and doubt. Doubt
is the result and the sign of unsuccessful compromises.</p>

<p>This superficial building up of compromises is
seen most clearly in the case of homosexuality. The
neurotic endeavors to focus the most divergent
tendencies of his psyche upon the same goal. His
ideal is a being at once male, female, and infantile
(and perhaps also beast and angel at the same time).</p>

<p>The neurotics always describe their ideal in a way
which corresponds to this polymorphous picture.
The males rave about women of a strikingly manly
bearing; heavy, angular figure, flat chest, energetic,
bony facial features, short hair, deep voice, traces
of facial hair or of a mustache. The hidden bisexual
ideal is thus partially fulfilled (Woman with
penis or man with vagina!). The repressed cravings,
thus partly freed, serve during sexual aggression
and further the attainment of gratification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>When nature fails to meet these needs, external
features, such as dress and ornaments are brought
into play to enhance the illusion. The symbol is
made to replace reality. Men fall in love with
women who wear tights (or who sport mannish
hats, officers’ coats, walking canes, etc.) and consequently
they are attracted by actresses, fencers,
cycle-riders, mountain-climbers, horseback-riders, or
by girls whom they chance to see in under-pants.
Others require of their sexual objects the adoption
of various male symbols before their libido is
roused. The woman, appeals to them, for instance,
at best, wearing a military blouse, a mannish hat, or
in some male attitude or other, capable of yielding
a suggestion of something genuine.</p>

<p>Women display parallel tendencies. They fall
in love with men who are beardless, gynecomastic,
men who have a large panniculus adiposus, broad
hips, delicate throat, female voice, or who wear
long coats and long hair. I will quote here only a
few examples: the priest, the physician in his
hospital coat, particularly surgeons with graceful
arms, female impersonators, beardless men, or men
with high voices who perfume themselves and wear
bracelets, and artists with long, flowing locks of
hair are likely to prove very attractive. (Perhaps
the great erotic attraction exercised by all artists is
due to their pronounced bisexual character.)</p>

<p>Physical factors are also of great significance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Women who smoke, ride, go mountain climbing and
who are generally aggressive, make a very strong
impression upon the neurotic. This is true also
about the influence of men with strong womanly
features upon women. Many neurotic men dream
of being overpowered. (The “pleasure without
guilt” principle!). Energetic women fascinate
them, just as delicate, sensitive men fascinate the
hysterical woman.</p>

<p>Less known are other masks of homosexuality
which I now mention. The love of old women
(gerontophilia) and passion for children often
covers a homosexual tendency. Persons deviating
from the complete male or female type often prove
irresistible for the same reason. Age eventually
wipes out the typical secondary sexual characters.
Man becomes like an old woman and old women acquire
remarkable male features (including mustache)
and male habits. Children also may figure
as a strong bisexual attraction since they lack the
secondary sexual characters.</p>

<p>A peculiar cryptic form under which male homosexuality
manifests itself, is the love of prostitutes.
The unconscious factor which here appeals to the
homosexual component of the sexual libido is the
fact that the body of the prostitute has been previously
enjoyed by other men.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>This process,—mediation through the other sex,—plays
a great role in homosexuality in various
other ways. The prostitute may be enjoyed only
in the presence of one or more male witnesses. The
carrying out of coitus jointly in one room, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
on, or allowing onlookers, also betray this motive
besides others.</p>

<p>In many cases the form of sexual intercourse
preferred betrays a latent homosexuality. Men
choose to lie underneath, or carry out coitus a
posteriori, or per anum. Women show corresponding
preferences. They attain supreme enjoyment
only if they are on top during intercourse. Many
paraphilias (fellatio, cunnilingus) betray a homosexual
trend besides showing sexual infantilism.</p>

<p>Various external signs may betray a strong homosexual
trend or mark a sudden outbreak of it. Men
suddenly decide to cut or shave off their beard.
They unexpectedly turn their interests to sports
which give them the opportunity of watching men
undressed. They become passionate fans around
prize rings, are seen at sun bathing establishments
and sporting places, or rave about the culture of
nakedness as a hygienic fad, etc. Women suddenly
find that they cannot possibly wear their long hair
and decide to cut it short. Sometimes they do it
without telling their husband so as to ‘pleasantly’
surprise him. They change fashions, take readily
to English jackets, tight coats and Girardi hats
and begin to show tremendous interest in the
emancipation of women.</p>

<p>Joint suicide as a mask is a subject to which I
can only refer briefly. Persons who do not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the courage to live together are the ones likely to
commit suicide jointly. The suicide of two friends,
male or female, is often due to unsatisfied homosexuality,
however ideal, apparently, the motives
may be. A life which does not yield to the full
gratification craved by the unconsciously operating
instincts, loses its zest. <i>Frenssen</i> states: “Sun,
moon and stars no longer carry any message to one
who has lost interest in them; a thing degenerates
unless cultivated assiduously; it is so with everything.
Indifference deadens; love breathes life into
everything.”</p>

<p>I have already pointed out in my treatise on
Onanism that those who have not given up the
habit may give expression to tendencies distinctly
homosexual through their autoerotic acts. The
feeling of guilt is due in part, although only in
part, to this cause. The greater hold the habit
has upon the individual the stronger also seems the
homosexual trait back of it. Many onanists are
asocial in their inclinations and avoid group life.
But I know a number who are enthusiastic ‘joiners,’
belonging to numerous organisations and always
eager to assume honorary membership in all sorts
of clubs. That female lawyers are particularly apt
to show homosexual tendencies is well known and
the fact is often exploited in the comic papers under
slight disguise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, I must mention another important form
of masked homosexuality: the artistic. Poets whose
preference is the delineation of female characters
are partly homosexual. They perceive accurately
the female emotions, they are able to portray with
fidelity the life of that sex, because they carry
within their breast, as it were, a goodly portion
of womanhood. <i>Chamisso</i> described so wonderfully
womanly love, because he himself was largely woman,
as his portrait is enough to indicate. Painters may
also show the reverse tendency. They paint preferably
male scenes or, as sculptors, create statues
of men. Their appraisal of esthetic values betrays
their hidden homosexuality. Some artists find the
male figure much more beautiful than the female,
others find the male body repulsive. An overstressed
aversion betrays the homosexual trend as clearly
as an emotionally overstressed preference.</p>

<p>The choice of a pseudonym may also prove a
characteristic sign. Just as the transvestites
(wearers of clothes of opposite sex) clearly show
their homosexual peculiarities thereby so do men
choosing a female pseudonym for their contributions
or writings, often betray their homosexuality
by the act. Of course, in the case of women, the
choice of a male nom de plume is determined partly
by the well known common notion that works obtain
a wider circulation if attributed to male author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>ship.
At any rate, it betrays a desire to be taken
for a man, by the readers, at least. A woman
writer whom I know and who is active under a male
nom de plume has told me, as an objection to this
view, that she is decidedly interested in men. She
confessed herself a Messalina. But back of such
an unsatisfied craving, there stands, as I have already
mentioned, homosexuality, the blind instinct,
ungratified. This woman preferred relations with
well known “women killers,” typical Cassanovas.
Obviously, the thought of the numerous female conquests
must have furnished here the chief attraction.
Such men carry about them the aroma of many
women. They must be proven masters of the art
of love and a woman is disposed to expect of them
special thrills and, possibly, new refinements of the
art; but the heroes, as a rule, when tried fail to
come up to the expectations lodged in them; they in
turn become easily tired of their new conquest. The
unsatisfied homosexual male is incapable of gratifying
completely the love hungry homosexual
woman. (That is the tragedy back of many unhappy
marriages.) It is also significant that this
woman, who otherwise had allowed herself an unusual
degree of freedom about sexual matters, looked
upon homosexuality as Tabu.</p>

<p>I have mentioned only a small number of the
possible masks of homosexuality. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
screens are so transparent they cannot but be
noticed even by those who are still novices in psychoanalytic
matters. One marries a girl, for instance,
after falling in love with that girl’s brother; or a
girl marries the brother of her homosexual choice,
as I have clearly shown in connection with the highly
instructive case history No. 93, in my study of
Anxiety States.</p>

<p>For this reason a friend’s wife may be a very
dangerous person and this mediation of homosexuality
through a third person has often been the
cause of terrific household dramas. I know men
who are regularly prone to fall in love with their
friends’ sweethearts, naturally, without suspecting
that back of this proclivity there stands the hidden
passion for their friend.</p>

<p>In conclusion I may point out another very significant
mask of homosexuality. I refer to psychic
impotence, which shows itself particularly during
attempted intercourse with respectable women. Men
potent with prostitutes but unable to carry out
coitus with a ‘decent’ woman, are latent homosexuals
whose libido is sufficiently roused in the presence
of the prostitute by the realisation that the
woman has been used before by another man. Of
course, a relative impotence of this character has
many other determinants. But the factor here mentioned
is never absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>The study of this cryptic form of homosexuality
alone will enable us to appreciate the inestimable
role of bisexuality in the mental life of modern man.</p>

<p>Other forms of masked homosexuality, manifested
in phobias and compulsion, I must mention only
superficially. There are men who become extremely
uneasy if some other man walks directly behind
them, men who are unable to remain with another
man alone in a room, men who always dream of
scenes in which some man points a revolver or knife
at them, or who have the uncomfortable feeling that
some hard substance, perhaps nothing more than an
indurated cylindrical mass of fæces, is pressing
within their rectum. With these peculiarities such
men betray their homosexuality, just as the paranoiacs
do with their delusions of persecution.</p>

<p>Women show similar phobias and more especially
morbid anxieties often centering around servant
girls. Women who change servant girls continually,
who worry themselves over the servant problem or
quarrel with the girls, or feel impelled to touch them
(acts which really take the place of sexual deeds)
are frequently homosexual. Similarly, various forms
of fetichism may be a cover for homosexuality.</p>

<p>It is plainly obvious that the study of sexual
masks promises to further immensely our knowledge
about matters of sex. At the same time it is clear
that the opposition of many circles to the new studies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
must remain a tremendous one. Possibly a great
deal of the opposition to the new psychology has
its roots in this very peculiarity of human nature.
Their basic bisexual predisposition is precisely what
men are least disposed to recognise.</p>

<p>These general statements I now propose to prove
on the basis of various observations from my practice
illustrating the great role played by the homosexual
components in the love life of average men
and women. This will show clearly why I never
use such terms as “contrary,” or “inverted” sexual
feeling, and why I never speak of “inversion,” or of
“perversion,” when I discuss homosexuality. The
very purpose of this work is to bring out the homosexual
components in the life of every person and to
bring out the normal feature of that state. For
normal is everything that is natural; <i>and from the
standpoint of nature we are never monosexual and
always bisexual</i>.</p>

<p>I regret that I must contradict so worthy an investigator
as <i>Hirschfeld</i>. But I fail to understand
the need of setting up, besides the hetero- and homosexuals,
a third group, the so-called transvestites.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Among the transvestites (personifiers) we find the
most pronounced examples of masked homosexuality
and stressed bisexuality. This is a designation
proposed by <i>Hirschfeld</i> for men who—obey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>ing
an overwhelming inner impulse—wear women’s
apparel and for women who similarly attire themselves
in things belonging to a man’s wardrobe.
In the course of an extensive review (<i>Zentrbl. f.
Psychoanalyse</i>, vol. I, p. 55.) I pointed out
that it is unnecessary to consider the transvestites
as a distinct sexual species, but that they are merely
bisexual persons with strong homosexual leanings.
<i>Hirschfeld</i> lays great emphasis upon the fact that
the transvestites experience normal sexual feelings,
being subject only to the impulsion to change their
clothing for that of the opposite sex. Unfortunately
here he takes into consideration only
the conscious sexual manifestations. He considers
merely the facts as they appear upon the surface
neglecting the important mechanisms of repression
and masking,—the tendency to play before, and
with, one’s self. The data obtained upon superficial
examination must be subjected to careful
analysis; then the results are most surprising.
Analysis invariably reveals that there is no such
thing as monosexuality and that the transvestites,
like the homosexuals, have their repressions. The
homosexual represses his heterosexuality, the
transvestite his homosexuality. In his phantasy
the man is a woman (the woman fancies herself the
reverse) and thus he combines the two components
of his libido. It were nothing less than doing vio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>lence
to facts to attempt to distinguish the transvestites
from the homosexuals.</p>

<p>As one reads carefully the cases published by
<i>Hirschfeld</i>, with an eye for signs of homosexuality,
one cannot fail to note characteristic traits of
homosexuality in every one of the cases. For instance,
one of them carries out succubus <i>in coitu</i>,
which is clearly a symptom of latent homosexuality;
if he appears as a woman, the men who follow him
cause him nausea. Another was able to carry out
the heterosexual act only under the influence of
alcohol, and when going out in women’s clothes was
fond of eating in the company of men and coquetting
with them. A third is repelled by the thought
of homosexual relations, but dreams of pregnancy,
plays succubus <i>in coitu</i>, and fancies that his wife is
a man. The fourth hugs his wife tightly, sinks his
nails into her ears, etc., so as to gain the illusion of
being overpowered through sheer force by some
man.</p>

<p>Then, most interesting of all, case 12: A man
who during four years of married life has carried
out coitus only once. This subject actually betrays
an open inclination towards homosexuality,
which <i>Hirschfeld</i> declares is only apparent....
How is one to determine between an apparent and
a real homosexual trend? In order to succeed in
that one must purposely overlook the phenomenon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of human bisexuality and be anxious to hold on at
all costs to the notion that homosexuality is inborn
and irreducible.</p>

<p>The transvestite last mentioned relates concerning
his homosexuality: “About homosexuality I
learned for the first time through reading the book:
<i>Die Enterbten des Liebesgluecks</i>. Some passages
gripped me powerfully, even more so than the works
on masochism, of which I also had read a large
number. As I had to renounce my womanly
ideal (for reasons mentioned previously), it occurred
to me to seek a man as the complement to my
yearnings. For even the strongest woman wants to
be beneath man during love. But I felt I needed a
partner who should overpower and conquer me with
some display of force. So I said to myself that
such a role can be filled properly only by a man. A
great deal of what I read in books about homosexuality
confirmed me in this view.”</p>

<p>If this is not a tell-tale rationalization of homosexuality—what
may we designate as homosexuality?</p>

<p>Comments are hardly needed in this connection.
On all sides and from all directions homosexuality
is proven in the history of the case. But <i>Hirschfeld</i>
finds that the tendency to homosexuality is only
apparent and that the whole foundation of the subject’s
libido consists of transvestism. The homosexuality
he looks upon as an incidental manifesta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>tion.
But there are no ‘incidental’ manifestations
in our vita sexualis. A dream, which has also been
reported, shows conclusively that M., the subject,
was all along actuated by the thought: I wish I
were a woman. But there are passages in this case
history showing how highly the subject esteems the
male and proving that this wish is an infantile attitude
and due to a feeling of inferiority. What else
should we conclude from the statement: “For the
genuine man, who belongs to the proudest specimens
of his sex, sexual gratification is merely a
hygienic requirement, a form of physical release;
beyond that his wonderful creative spirit dwells in
higher realms ... etc.”</p>

<p>In the chapter devoted to masochism I explain
the meaning of a case like the above more fully.
The man wants to be a woman and to be overpowered.
He is able to have relations with women,
if they assume the aggressive role. His mind insists
upon the fictive notion: I am a woman and I
am forced to carry out this part. Naturally he
shifts towards homosexual acts. The male trait in
him tolerates no submissiveness. The female trait
lends itself readily to coercion. The neurosis consists
in this suppression of the male components of
the sexual instinct.</p>

<p>A careful reading of the following case history
will show clearly the homosexual roots of the
tendency to personify the opposite sex:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. H. S. consults me on account of complete
sexual frigidity during her marital relations. She
is twenty-four years of age and had married at the
age of 19. Her marriage was a love affair. She
has always been of a loving and sensuous disposition
so that from the age of 14 her mind was preoccupied
mostly with sexual fancies and thoughts.
At the age of 15 she fell in love with an uncle. His
kisses roused her passion and she would have readily
yielded to him. The father observed what was
going on and forbade her uncle the house. She
lived in the Country and met no men under circumstances
which could have endangered her. She was
19 years of age when she first met her present husband
and she fell rapidly in love with him. She
withstood her parents’ opposition and married the
young man in a few months. Already during her
engagement she said to her husband: “I don’t believe
one man will be enough for me. You must
watch out for me....” During the first few weeks
of married life her husband was impotent, and this
drove her nearly to distraction. After her husband
underwent some medical treatment he succeeded in
rupturing her hymen and in a few months she became
pregnant. For a short time during that first
pregnancy she experienced complete orgasm. After
that her feeling for her husband disappeared entirely
and she felt very dissatisfied. Her whole
character changed completely. Previously she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
been happy, joyous, always in good humor. Now
she became quiet, lived a retired existence, avoiding
men in particular because she was afraid of them.</p>

<p>Deeper investigation of the case shows that, after
the death of her father, to whom she felt attached
by bonds of deepest affection, she became sexually
anesthetic. The father was a very earnest, strong
man who adored his pretty wife and he was a model
of loyal and dutiful husband. The mother was an
artist who, after the death of her husband, lost all
interest in life. She could not stay alone and
abandoned the country place to live with her
daughter in the City. I suspected that the sudden
onset of anesthesia probably coincided with the
mother’s arrival in the house. Might she not hide
some special attachment for her mother?</p>

<p>She emphasized that she felt the greatest compassion
for her mother, who had lost her support
in life. For her mother’s sake she would have
gladly taken her father’s place, if such a thing were
possible. And further she declared:</p>

<p>“You would probably find it almost unbelievable,
if I told you that I strongly wished I were a man,
at the time. I kept thinking of mother all the
time! You see—she is so pretty and young yet,
so full of life! I also know that she is a very
passionate woman. How could she get along without
a man? Now, I must confess something,
though it is very hard for me to express it. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
know already a number of my pet fancies. But
there is another which I have persistently kept from
you till now. I wanted to put on father’s clothes,
as I have a few of them in my possession, and to go
to mother’s bed at night. I acquired a sort of an
apparatus ... for the purpose. But I did not
quite have the courage. I put on the clothes but
stayed in my room. I kept standing before the looking
glass for hours, looking on.”</p>

<p>“Did the clothes fit you?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I had used some of father’s
old suits for a long time before that. I got hold
of them under all sorts of pretexts. I wrote him,
for instance, that I wanted to give his unused
clothes to a worthy poor man. Then I had them
altered for a figure of my size and was glad to wear
them while my husband was away. Already as a
small girl I remember I was fond of wearing my
brother’s clothes.”</p>

<p>“Do you recollect your thoughts while you were
wearing your brother’s clothes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do. I played I was papa. For a time I
felt really dissatisfied because I was a girl. I envied
all boys.”</p>

<p>“Later, too, after you were married already?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Do you know, I have never mustered
enough courage to do something downright disloyal.
But I was thinking, if I were a man, I could
never remain true. I have always envied men. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
fact, with my soul I felt myself more like a man.”</p>

<p>“What were your feelings during the time you
were in love with your husband?”</p>

<p>“I had plunged headlong into love and forgot all
about my liking of men’s clothes. During that time
I felt altogether womanly. Especially when I became
a mother. Then all my dreams about manliness
disappeared.”</p>

<p>“That was also the only time when you enjoyed
your relations with your husband?”</p>

<p>“I have never thought of the two things together.
But you are right. For a short time
during that period I was entirely womanly, until
father died....”</p>

<p>“And your mother came to live with you!”</p>

<p>“Yes ... that is so.... Do you mean, that
then I wanted again to be a man? Now, I can confess
to you that I always envied father on account
of mama. I used to think that if I were a man, I
should certainly be in love with mama.”</p>

<p>The further analysis reveals interesting details.
Repeatedly she dreams that she is a man and that
she has a phallus. She dreams also that she urinates
standing after the manner of men. She admits
that, already as a child, she loved her mother passionately.
She had also overheard a number of
times her parents getting together in bed and once
she watched them in the act of coitus, peeping
through a key hole. She was deeply excited by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
what she saw and thought that her mother must
have suffered great pain and that only the father
found pleasure in the act. This infantile conception
of male gratification has remained with her to this
day. Her favorite expression: “If I should come
again into the world I would want to be a man.”
The homosexual attitude towards the mother deprived
her of libido during her marital relations.</p>

<p>I suggested that she should separate from her
mother but she resented scornfully this suggestion.
She would rather give up her husband. Some time
later she actually did so. She now lives with her
mother. I was greatly surprised one day, when
she called on me clothed in male attire. She requested
from me a certificate to the effect that she
was an abnormal person and should be permitted to
wear man’s clothes. She had heard that in Berlin
a number of women had been granted such a permit
by the police on the strength of such a statement
from a physician.</p>

<p>Upon being questioned regarding her sexual life
she states that she now maintains relations with a
man who, before the sexual embrace, puts on
women’s clothes. This rouses great orgasm in her.
Regarding her relations to her mother her answers
are elusive. But I must not think, she adds, that
she is a “Urlinde.” The thought of such persons
only fills her with disgust. Her mother is now
merely her dearest friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>It is plain that this woman has repressed her
homosexual love for her mother and is satisfied with
the symbol of masculinity, the wearing of trousers.
The man whom she meets in embrace, becomes for
her a woman, through the wearing of feminine
articles. Thus the two partners carry on a comedy
in which the heterosexual act replaces the longed-for
homosexual embrace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am familiar with a number of instances in which
a man dressing like a woman, or the reverse, was the
means of rousing sexual passion, or, at least, of increasing
it enormously. Whenever this happens it
is plainly a manifestation of latent homosexuality,—a
condition of which <i>Blueher</i> appears to have a
very poor opinion. Although he seems to agree
with my views otherwise (“today it is no longer
possible,” he says, “to hold that homosexuality or
heterosexuality is inborn; instead we must recognize
that bisexuality is inborn in every individual,
with a special predilection in one direction or the
other,”), he makes a distinction between “healthful
inversion” and an outbreak of latent homosexuality;
one condition he considers aboriginal and in keeping
with cultural development, while the other “arises
out of the depths of the unconscious, through the
removal of the inhibitions....” This view is also
contrary to facts. <i>Blueher</i>, like <i>Hirschfeld</i>, is inclined
to consider latent homosexuality as ‘pseudo,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
as something unnatural, and accordingly passes
judgment upon it. The practical observations
gathered in the course of my practice do not coincide
with these theoretical assumptions. I know
only one kind of homosexuality, and that is always
inborn. Also, I find it always linked intimately
with heterosexuality. Awareness of one’s own
homosexual tendency or lack of it is not a reliable
guide. If the number of consciously homosexual
persons be estimated at 2 per cent., we may confidently
assert that there are 98 per cent. of persons
who know nothing of their homosexual traits, or
rather that they do not want to know anything
about them.</p>

<p>As we become familiar with the various masks of
homosexuality, we learn to appreciate surprising
homosexual and heterosexual trends. I shall draw
attention merely to the manifold significance of
“trousers” in human love affairs. How often men
fall in love with women only when and because they
are seen in tights! I remember a number of classmates
in high school, who had fallen in love with a
singer, when they saw her in a role which she played
wearing tights. <i>Grillparzer</i> apparently fell in love
once in his life and very passionately. It was with
the singer to whom he absent-mindedly sent his
famous poem. She had appeared upon the stage as
a Cherub in tights. The woman wearing the
trousers is a by-word,—a typical compromise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Through the medium of such compromises it becomes
possible for the homosexual suddenly to act
like a heterosexual person. <i>Hirschfeld</i>, who was
the first to point out this fact, relates that a lieutenant
of cavalry well known in the circle of Berlin
urnings one day surprised his acquaintances with
the announcement of his engagement and even more
with the statement he had become fully heterosexual.
Previous to that time he had loved only boys in
girls’ clothes but apparently he had found a woman
of very youthful type, one who was able to satisfy
both components of his libido. Symbols at times
disclose tremendous power. The trousers figure as
a symbol of masculinity. I remember the storm of
popular indignation which arose once when some
change in women’s fashions threatened man’s exclusive
prerogative. The skirt and long hair are
symbols of feminity. The symbol often furnishes
the bridge across which traits, otherwise antagonistic,
become fused.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following case is an illustration:</p>

<p>Mr. E. W. has practiced onanism since he was
five years of age and during the act was in the habit
of thinking he was touching girls. Later he masturbated
jointly with other school boys. They attempted
pederastic acts, in the course of which he
felt neither aversion nor pleasure. At 14 years of
age he was seduced by a servant girl, and he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
to her bed every night for a year. A poor scholar
up till that time, he became subsequently one of the
best in the class. After a time he became tired of
her and he sought other opportunities which were
easy to find. He maintains that up to his 20th year
he has had intercourse with every one of the girls who
served in his parents’ house, and he estimates them
to have been about twenty in number. It struck
him that he could not always achieve orgasm. But
he was always potent, so much so, sometimes the
girls wondered. But he would become indifferent
before reaching ejaculation. This happened to him
with fat women who excited him tremendously and
at the same time failed to satisfy him.</p>

<p>He began early to be interested in painting and
made special efforts to experience the feeling of love;
for the petty adventures with the servant girls did
not involve the heart in the least. As he grew all
women only appeared to him to be merely objects for
the gratification of lust. He had all sort of love
affairs but could be true to none for any length of
time and did not always reach orgasm with them.
He happened to try once the situs inversus and
after that he found it always possible to bring about
the orgasm. Coitus a posteriori was also a method
which enabled him to attain this aim more easily
than the normal position. He was already thirty
years of age when he saw at a social affair a girl
who appeared as a boy in a “living picture.” He felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
at once the greatest attraction for her. During
the whole evening he kept her in his company, and
he felt animated and inspired with the thought that
he had found, at last, his soul affinity. A few weeks
later he became engaged to her. The picture of her
as a boy always floated before his mind. He married
soon, experienced tremendous orgasm during
coitus and felt himself very happily married. After
a few years his potentia began to fail him and this
worried him a great deal because he loved his wife
tremendously and was ashamed to confess to her the
true state of things. He became more frigid and
finally his potentia failed him completely.</p>

<p>He came into his wife’s room (they had separate
rooms) while she was undressing. She was in her
tights, the kind in which he had seen her in the role
of a boy. At once this roused his passion and he
threw himself upon his wife, covering her with kisses,
against her protests, for she was very bashful.
This happened in day time. His wife had never
consented to coitus in day time before. But this
time she was taken by surprise and as he pressed her
for it, she called out, over and over: “What is the
matter with you today!” He did not tell her the
reason for his excitement; he was ashamed to request
her to dress herself next time in tights.</p>

<p>He called to have this remarkable occurrence explained
and to be cured of the peculiarity. Later
he achieved potentia again but always he had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
think of his wife as dressed in trousers. The man
was an out-of-town resident and had come to
Vienna only for the day. I was unable to find out
much about the psychic roots of this condition. He
recalled no infantile memories, but thought that the
sight of his little sister in bloomers had already
roused him. He was much interested in women’s
underwear and could have easily turned into a
fetichist, one gathering a large assortment of
women’s underclothes. I advised him to confide in
his wife and ask her for his sake to dress herself in
the kind of apparel which appealed to him. That
was, after all, a harmless desire which he shared
with many other men.</p>

<p>A few years later I saw him again. He had followed
my advice, and his wife, who loved him devotedly,
had finally consented, because he could not
attain erection otherwise, and she required the fulfilment
of marital relations. Since she “gave in” to
her husband’s peculiar request, she is able to rouse
him to coitus as often as she desires it. She only
needs to put on tights.... He experiences the
greatest satisfaction while his wife wears tights and
they assume the situs inversus. Through such a
small compromise, by meeting some specific phantasy,
it is often possible to turn an incompatible
marriage into a happy one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>This is not the only case of its kind of which I
know. I know men who, when going to houses of
prostitution request the women to retain their
drawers when undressing. Others actually demand
that the girls should put on male trousers. These
latent homosexuals are well known to the prostitutes.
They remain passive and expect the woman
to be aggressive. This shows they maintain the
fiction that they are females and they require relatively
but little in the form of overt acts to maintain
this fiction in their mind. Many an instance
of love at first sight is induced in the same way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Case. Z. I. A man, 48 years of age, had several
light love affairs, was twice unhappily married.
After the second separation—some six years previously—he
left women severely alone because he had
a poor opinion of them. He used to say: all women
are worthless decoys and it is a pity to turn a single
hair grey on their account. In the circle of women
haters he was known for that reason as the decoy-man.
His physical sexual needs he satisfied with
prostitutes or street acquaintances. Beyond that
he avoided women and sought only the company of
men. It was obvious that he was drifting away
from heterosexuality and leaning towards psychic
homosexuality. Then it happened that he agreed
once to sit as a model for a woman artist. The
sculptress was in ordinary clothes and had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
no particular impression on him. She asked him to
wait a few moments and then she stepped out to
put on her working clothes. When she reappeared,
a few moments later, he was astonished. She wore
a long white coat, which covered her whole dress, a
pleasing little cap, under which she had tucked her
hair to protect it against the dust, and a pair of
glasses which she wore only when working. She
appeared so attractive that he fell in love with her
that moment. He did not hide his feelings but immediately
hastened to make up on the spot what he
had lost in six years of opportunities to worship at
the shrine of womanhood. She accepted his compliments
good-naturedly. He fell in love with her
as he had never been in love before. A few weeks
later he proposed marriage, but she politely refused.
She had made up her mind never to marry. But he
did not give her up; on the contrary he pursued her
with his attentions and tendernesses. His club and
all his cronies he abandoned. He was head over
heels in love, like a frisky boy, and held that now
he knew the meaning of love. One of his friends
proposed to cure him of his infatuation and told him
in confidence that he had heard the sculptress was
a homosexual who maintained relations with a chorus
girl wearing tights. The whole town knew about
it. It was an open secret. This information had
the contrary effect upon him. His passion reached
such a point that life seemed to him worthless with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>out
her. He struggled with thoughts of suicide
and told the beloved about it. This made a strong
impression upon her and she stated frankly: she
would agree to be his sweetheart, but his wife, never.
For a time he fought against accepting this compromise,
desiring nothing short of a union for life.
Finally he acquiesced. She was a virgin no longer
and told him that she had already been her instructor’s
sweetheart. That is why she did not
want to consider marriage. With her instructor,
however, she had never achieved orgasm. His embrace
left her cold. She could achieve satisfaction
and orgasm only with the aid of <i>manipulatio cum
digito</i>.</p>

<p>Z. I. remained faithful to her for a few years and
during that time tried several times to induce her to
consider marriage. He was always most excited
when he saw her wearing the apparel which had first
roused his love for her. They always met in her
studio while she was wearing her working clothes.
Finally his love cooled and he returned to the society
of his woman-hating companions. An attempt to
have intercourse with a girl in his employ failed him
and he called for advice.</p>

<p>He believed himself impotent. But it was merely
the homosexual trait which comes to the fore at this
age in various manifestations which physicians call
the climacterium of man.</p>

<p>Analysis disclosed that the woman sculptor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the cousin of one of his favorite old school mates,
whom she resembled closely. This young man also
wore, while at work in his laboratory, a white coat,
like the sculptress. It was this similarity that
roused his libido so tremendously. The young man
had become engaged a few weeks previously. He
disapproved the young man’s step on various
grounds. (A young man should not jeopardise his
scientific career on account of a woman.) He was
in love with the young man without realising it. The
transference of the feeling into a heterosexual one
was mediated through the fact that the woman
looked like her cousin and the costume also helped
to transfer some of the homosexual tendencies into
the heterosexual channel.</p>

<p>In connection with this case I may make a few
remarks about the so-called climacterium of man
and about woman’s critical period. The psychic
process is well known, in so far as it involves a
parting from one’s youth, and it has been repeatedly
outlined and described. The whole love instinct
of man rebels against growing old and fosters the
utilization to the utmost of the opportunities during
the few remaining years. The milder the sexual
life in the past, the greater and more stormy becomes
the need of making up for lost opportunities
“while there is time.”</p>

<p>But the significance of homosexuality during this
critical period is a matter which most investigators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
have overlooked. It may be that the involution of
the sexual glands brings the opposite sex into
stronger relief at this period. One who conceives
bisexuality as a chemical process—and there are
some data apparently supporting such a view—may
speak of the conquest of man’s heterosexuality over
homosexuality. <i>Hirschfeld</i> would say of a man:
as he now produces less andrin the gynecin achieves
upper hands. Perhaps many cases of so-called late
homosexuality (<i>Krafft-Ebing</i>) may be explained in
this manner. I have known a man who, up to the
50th year of his life, has had no sexual experiences
and who was also unaware of his homosexuality.
At that age he happened to drift into the company
of homosexuals and now he is a confirmed member
of the third (intermediate) sex. Possibly the outbreak
of homosexuality leading all the way to paranoia—a
subject which I shall take up more fully in
another chapter—depends on changes in the sexual
glands, these changes leading to characteristic psychic
expression.</p>

<p>In the last case disappointment after marriage
(both women proved unfaithful to the man) induced
the breaking forth of the homosexual tendencies.</p>

<p>The behavior of those persons who do not care
to acknowledge their homosexuality is characteristic.
So passionately do they fall in love, their
impulsion to loving is so tremendous that every new
passion surpasses all previous experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>This peculiarity gives us an insight into the mentality
of the Don Juan type, the desolute adventurer,
and the Messalina type....</p>

<p>The flight away from homosexuality leads the individual
to overstress his heterosexuality (with the
formulation of compromises and the adoption of
homosexual masks) but that seldom yields the satisfaction
craved by the individual. The sexual adventurer
is always a person who has failed to find
proper gratification. He who has found complete
gratification becomes thereby master of his libido
and knows the meaning of satiety. When the gratification
is only apparent the craving leads soon
again to new adventures. Just as the compulsory
acts of neurotics cannot be permanently removed,
because such acts are only symptomatic and stand
for hidden cravings, the unsatisfied homosexual
longing which stands masked under an apparently
excessive heterosexuality cannot be completely
gratified on that path. The sexual instinct,—as
<i>Freud</i> has pointed out—is of complex character and
is seldom brought into play in its full form. Man’s
unattainable ideal is the whole instinct, undivided
and unhampered in any of its component parts;
falling in love manifests the expectation of a gratification
previously unattained.</p>

<p>During man’s critical period—as well as woman’s—a
number of troublesome compulsion neuroses are
likely to break forth and these have been erroneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>ly
attributed to excitement, overwork, and other
secondary factors. Every compulsion neurosis appearing
at this period is a complicated riddle through
which the subject aims to hide before his own consciousness
no less than before the world at large the
true significance of the psychic impulses which reassert
their supremacy at the time. Frequently
back of the various symptomatic acts it is possible
to discern the clear mechanism of defence against
homosexuality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next case shows an interesting array of symbolisms
and of symbolic acts, which are easily understood
if one has the key to the psychology of such
mental processes.</p>

<p>Mr. B. experiences the outbreak of an acute neurosis
at 60 years of age. Suddenly he becomes obsessed
with the fear of tuberculosis. He is firmly
convinced that he is a victim of the disease and the
reassurance of famous specialists quiets him only
for a few days. He reads all popular works on
tuberculosis as well as the scientific works of Cornet,
Koch, and other investigators. He has worked out
for himself a systematic method for the cure of
tuberculosis. He holds, in the first place, that cold
air is the best, and takes long walks out of doors,
sleeps with all windows wide open, goes to Davos
and generally prefers winter sporting places. He
is a confirmed believer in the theory of infection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
through particles of sputum and therefore avoids
the proximity of ... men.</p>

<p>“Why be afraid specially of men? May not
women also carry the infection?”</p>

<p>“No; women do not expectorate so vigorously.
Men spit all over, women only close by!”</p>

<p>“How do you know these things?”</p>

<p>“You see, I have given the matter a great deal of
thought and I have studied the subject. I thought
to myself, coughing and urinating are very much
alike. In both operations products of the organism
are removed from the body. A woman urinates
with a small stream which does not reach far. But
many men urinate with force and are able to throw
out their stream,—a distance of several feet.”</p>

<p>Already this statement showed that back of the
fear of consumption there stood some hidden sexual
motive. B. carried the analogy still further:</p>

<p>“Men are also able to ejaculate, while women only
omit a little moisture which trickles down upon their
parts.... At any rate, I am particularly afraid
of infection through some tubercular man.”</p>

<p>I inquired into the circumstances under which
this fear first showed itself and how long he had it
and in reply received the following interesting confession:</p>

<p>“For a long time I lived with a nephew who occupied
a separate room in my home. My married
daughter came once to pay us a visit because her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
child had whooping cough and she was advised that
a change of air would be beneficial.”</p>

<p>(It is characteristic that he was not afraid of
catching whooping cough, although he knew of a
serious case,—an elderly man who had caught the
infection and as a result was seriously ill for months.
The fear of tuberculosis thus shows itself to be a
misdirected notion.)</p>

<p>“It became necessary for me to share with my
nephew the same sleeping room,” continued the man.
“He had but recently returned from Meran and was
considered cured.... But you know, how these alleged
cures turn out upon closer examination. During
the night I became uneasy and several times I
heard my nephew coughing. I noticed that he did
not sleep, and I also could not fall asleep because
the thought tormented me that I would surely catch
the infection. The first thing I did next morning
was to call my physician; he laughed at me but
upon my persistent questioning he told me: ‘If you
are as afraid as all that, you better sleep in a
separate room!’ I did not wait to be told twice
and for a number of weeks after that I slept at a
hotel. But here too, I began to think, perhaps
some tubercular man has occupied the room before
me, and could not sleep! I had night sweats and
after that I no longer believed the physicians’ reassurances
and was convinced that this was a sign
of the first stage of consumption....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>We note that the elderly gentleman had become
homosexually roused by the presence of his nephew
and this craving appeared to his consciousness
masked under the form of a fear of tubercular infection.</p>

<p>“I could tear my hairs out by the roots, to think
that I had done such a foolish thing!”</p>

<p>“What foolish thing?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sleeping in the same room with my
nephew. If I had at least put up a Japanese screen.
But, unfortunately, one does foolish things without
reflecting upon the consequences....”</p>

<p>B. also displays various compulsory mannerisms,
the meaning of which becomes obvious once we appreciate
that, in his case, ‘tuberculosis’ really means
‘homosexuality.’ As he walks upon the City streets
he meets a man coming his way. While still at a
distance he steps aside or crosses on the other side;
he no longer shakes hands with any man, not even
with his friends; one may become infected with
tubercle bacilli in that way. All places where men
are seen naked or in partial undress, such as gymnasia
or bathing resorts, are breeding spots for
tubercular infection.</p>

<p>Moreover, B. shows some female traits in his
nature. He has shaved his beard because hairs may
be nests for tubercle bacilli; he has become emotional,
whining and he is unable to arrive at decisions
promptly. He finds the fashion of wearing short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
coats not “dressy” and wears a long coat that has
almost the appearance of a jacket. (Similar mannerisms
are found in <i>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</i>; <i>vid.</i>
his <i>Confessions</i>.)</p>

<p>This case is one of almost complete outbreak of
femininity, closely allied to the paranoiac forms,
which will be considered more fully in another
chapter. He is also jealous of his wife and thinks
he is slighted,—that he is not given the proper degree
of attention. He is excitable, sleepless, dissatisfied
with life. After a few hours the analysis
is given up.</p>

<p>Such persons are tremendously afraid of the
truth; they wander from physician to physician and
really want but one thing: to preserve their secret
and to devote themselves more and more to their
hidden homosexuality. If the condition were once
disclosed before their eyes they could not continue
their indulgence so easily. They always break up
the treatment after a few hours under some pretext
or other and this justifies the suspicion that, sooner
or later, they come to regard the physician also as
a man and, transferring their homosexual attachment
to the physician they flee from the danger of
being together with the object of their love.</p>

<p>This case illustrates, I believe, what remarkable
masks the outbreak of the homosexual trait is capable
of assuming. Similar masks are the fear of
syphilis, the fear of “blood poisoning,” and the dread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
of physical contact with other persons or objects.
The fear of syphilis covers also other dreads.
Formerly I thought that syphilidophobia was only
a mask for incest craving. I am now convinced that
it stands for “forbidden love” generally. Syphilis
stands as a symbol either for incest or for homosexuality.
‘Becoming infected’ means: ‘being oppressed’
by homosexual or incestuous tendencies.
These figures of speech are suggested by the every
day use of language. One hears, for instance, that
the whole city of Berlin is infected with homosexuality;
the opponents of homosexuality fight
against the plague which threatens the whole German
nation; young men are warned against being infected
with homosexuality. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the morbid expressions of neuroses
assume similar figurative forms.</p>

<p>The rise of such morbid fear during advanced
age is always suspicious of an outbreak of homosexuality,
against which various protective devices
are thus raised. If I should attempt to describe
all these forms of outbreak and all the protective
devices I would have to write a special treatise on
anxiety states. We well know already that all
neuroses have a bisexual basis. But, what is more,
I maintain that homosexuality plays a far greater
role in the development of neurotic traits than any
other suppressed instincts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>I am now turning my attention to a character in
whom homosexuality would hardly be suspected as
a motive power. I refer to the Don Juan type of
personality. The Messalina type I shall describe
in connection with my study of sexual anesthesia in
woman. But the Don Juan character deserves
special attention in this connection.</p>

<p>One would think that a man who devotes his whole
life to women, who dreams day and night only of new
conquests, who considers every woman worth while
when opportunity favors him, a man for whom no
woman is too old, or too ugly, if he desires her,—that
such a man would be far removed from any
homosexual trend. Yet the contrary is the fact
and the greater my opportunity to study the
‘woman chaser’ the stronger my conviction becomes
that, back of the ceaseless hunt, stands the longing
after the male. Though many explanations have
been offered for the Don Juan type,—that prototype
of Faust’s—none has solved satisfactorily the
riddle of his psyche. Only the recognition of latent
homosexuality promises to clear for us the meaning
of this character.</p>

<p>What are the typical character traits attributed
to the Don Juan type? His easily stirred passion;
secondly, his indiscriminate taste; thirdly, his sudden
cooling off. Of course, there are any number
of transitional forms and mixed stages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>I choose for examination the fundamental type,
as he is known to me through a number of concrete
examples. This triad: “quickly roused, not particular
as to choice, just as quickly cooled,” admits
of numerous variations. Particularly the choice of
the sexual object is something that in many woman
chasers becomes determined on the basis of particular
fetichistic preferences, such as red hair, virginity,
a particular figure, a special occupation, etc.
The Don Juan collectors of women are differentiated
into various distinct classes. I knew one who
for his record of adventures specialized in widows.
The shorter the period of widowhood the greater
was his ambition to make the conquest. Only
women in mourning attracted him. But beyond
this point he was not particular. It made no difference
to him whether the woman was young or old,
beautiful or homely, so long as she was a widow in
mourning. His greatest pride he took in his conquest
of widows on the burial day.</p>

<p><i>Oskar A. H. Smitz</i>, (in his <i>Cassanova und Andere
erotische Charaktere</i>, Stuttgart, 1906, quoted after
<i>Bloch</i>), has attempted to trace a fine distinction between
the Don Juan and the Cassanova type: “Don
Juan is a deceiving, cunning seducer to whom the
sense of possessing the woman, the feeling of danger,
and the pleasure of overcoming resistance and of
exercising his manly strength are the chief things,
but he is not erotic, whereas Cassanova is the erotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
type par excellence; he, too, is tricky and remorseless,
but he craves the satisfaction of his sensuous
needs rather than of his sense of power. Don Juan
sees only women, for Cassanova every woman is “the
woman.” Don Juan is demonic, devilish, he deliberately
plans the destruction of the women who
yield to him and drives them to perdition, while
Cassanova is humane, he is always interested in the
happiness of his sweethearts and preserves of them
tender memories. Don Juan hates woman, he is a
typical misogynist, the satanic type of woman hater,
whereas Cassanova is a typical feminist, he has a
deep and sympathetic understanding of woman’s
soul, he is not deceived by his love affairs but needs
continual intercourse with women as the condition
of his happiness. Don Juan seduces through his
demonic character, with the brutal, and wild, attraction
exercised by his uncanny power, Cassanova
achieves his conquests through the more refined
gentle atmosphere generated by his charming
presence.”</p>

<p><i>Bloch</i> introduces a third type, the pseudo-Don
Juan, or more correctly, the pseudo-Cassanova,—the
adventurer perennially disappointed in his conquests,
of whom Retif de la Bretonne is the nearest
widely known type. He is continually looking for
the true love and never finds it. While I admit that
the seducer as a type belongs to one of these categories,
I must designate all three classes mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
above, that is, the Don Juan, the Cassanova, and the
would-be type of either, as bearers, alike, of a latent
homosexuality. None of them finds his ideal. Retif
de la Bretonne is the perennially disappointed
type, and true love is something he can never find;
in his love he displays considerable dependence on
woman. He portrays the hopeless flight to woman
and away from man. Cassanova feels all the time
impelled to prove to himself how seductive a fellow
and man he is and every new conquest gives him a
new opportunity to do so. Woman is to him but a
means to enhance his sense of virility. He must not
depreciate his conquest for the glory of his achievement
would be lessened in his own eyes if he were to
do so.</p>

<p>The Don Juan type is close to the level which
leads directly to the well known Marquis de Sade
type of character. He scorns woman because she
is incapable of yielding to him all the gratification
for which he yearns. He is perennially searching
for release and in that respect bears some resemblance
to the Flying Dutchman who is similarly
in quest of love and whom the quest leads eventually
to death. But I cannot concur with the idea that
these types are so sharply differentiated as <i>Schmitz</i>
and <i>Bloch</i> are inclined to maintain. We meet the
finest gradations and the most varied combinations.
Moreover individuals change, their character shift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>ing
from one type to another by imperceptible degrees
in the course of time.</p>

<p>I propose to consider Don Juan as the representative
of the type of seducer, irrespective of
further variations. In fact it is characteristic of
all the types mentioned above that they are alike
unable to remain loyal in their love. And, in my
view, this is the most important characteristic.</p>

<p>Ready excitability, scorn of womankind, latent
cruelty, and perennial readiness for love adventures
are traits which show that, in the last analysis,
Don Juan represents a type of unsatisfied libido.
For him the most important moment is the conquest
of the woman. In the joy of this conquest
there is betrayed something of the scorn of woman
which plays such an important role in the lives of
all homosexuals—whether latent or manifest. For
the genuine Don Juan the conquest of a woman is
a task which appeals to his play lust. Will he succeed
with this one, and with that one, and with the
third woman? Each new conquest reassures him
that he is irresistible, magical in his charm, so that
he can say to himself: <i>thou art a real man</i>! He
must reassure himself over and over that he is fully
a man because he fears his femininity too strongly;
with the aid of his feminine trait he is the better able
to achieve his conquests among women because that
trait enables him the better to feel and know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
every woman wants. He is really but a woman in
man’s clothes. His narcissistic character (the
morbid self-love) requires continually new proofs
of his irresistible powers. This type of man, one
who practices all sorts of perversions on women and
in this very changing of the manner of his loving
betrays his insatiable quest for new and untried
gratifications, never permits himself any homosexual
act, although he is far from particular otherwise
and has run the gamut of tasting all ugly and
forbidden fruit. Homosexuality strikes this type
of man as disgusting and unbearable, he must spit
out when meeting a fellow of that kind, he would
have all men and women of that kind in jail, he
would have them rooted out as one would a plague.
Towards homosexuality his attitude is emotionally
overstressed, showing that this negative form of
disgust and neurotic repulsion really covers the
positive trend of longing. But at the same time
he looks for women who are mannish in appearance
and who lack the secondary sexual characteristics,
thin, ephebic women, matrons and girls who are so
young as to look like children and thus represent
really intermediary stages towards manhood.</p>

<p>Certain aversions, which <i>Hirschfeld</i> has described
as antifetichistic, sometimes disclose the homosexual
character of their libido and the protective means
adopted against the recognition of homosexuality.
One man dislikes woman with large feet, another is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
repelled by women with hair on their bodies. Such
a woman causes him to have distinct nausea. A third
one is repelled by the presence of hair upon the
woman’s upper lip, or by a deep voice. There are,
besides, all sorts of transitional types. One seeks
only the completely developed and typical female
figure, another is attracted particularly by the
type of woman resembling the male figure but without
disdaining the former type.</p>

<p>His search is endless because he is truly, though
secretly, attracted by the male. His sexual goal is
man. Through each new woman he expects to experience,
at last, the completely satisfactory gratification
which he craves. But he turns away from
each one equally disappointed because his libido
cannot be fully gratified by any of them. In the
manner of his conquering and abandoning each
woman he shows his scorn of the sex. The true
woman lover is really no Don Juan because he
distributes his sexual libido among a few women at
the most and the emotional overvaluation of these
women furnishes the key to his attitude towards the
whole sex. Don Juan makes love in a manner apparently
as if he respected womankind. But the
cold manner in which he dismisses his victims betrays
his complete contempt for the sex. He admires only
the women who withstand him and whom he cannot
subdue. Such resistance may lead eventually to the
marriage of a Don Juan, a marriage which neces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>sarily
proves unhappy and he continues his former
life. For the step has not furnished him what he
is really seeking, man has eluded him again.</p>

<p>Closer examination reveals the characteristic fact
that frequently the choice of lovers is determined
by homosexual traits of one kind or another. The
Don Juan who runs after married women may be
goaded on by the fact that he likes the physical appearance
of their husbands. Naturally the thought
heightens his feeling of self-esteem because it must
be a harder task to induce the wife of a handsome
man to deceive her husband than it would be to bring
to one’s feet the wife of an ugly man. A Don Juan
told me once: “I have possessed all sorts of women,
but never cared for the wife of a simpleton. I have
always considered it beneath me and not worth while
to deceive a fool.” Here we have a type of man
desirous to measure his wit against that of a sharp
rival. (If you are so very sharp, why don’t you
look out better for your wife!) The emphasis here
is really upon the fact that he likes the husband,
admires him, and considers him a bright man. Before
he makes up his mind to get a woman he must
like her husband, and he can be attracted only by
intelligent men. That condition is imperative before
he engages in any love adventure. <i>Maupassant</i>
describes this type of man in one of his stories. The
hero is interested only in married women whose husbands
attract him and are among his friends. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
give the history of an extreme case of this type in
my chapter on jealousy in the present work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>H. O., 49 years of age, is undergoing a severe
mental crisis. He relates that he was happily married,
until an actress crossed his path. He fell so
deeply in love he could not leave her, he neglected
his home, was unable to follow his calling and was
on the point of committing suicide. It was not his
custom to cling for long to any one woman. Usually
he changed sweethearts every few weeks.</p>

<p>“Did you say that your married life was happy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that has never troubled me. I cannot be
true to any woman. I must change all the time. I
am a polygamous being. This woman is the first to
whom I feel loyal and true right along, I did not feel
so towards my wife and only a few weeks after marriage
I preferred the embrace of other women, but
this sweetheart of mine,—she has taken me off my
balance entirely, to her I am loyal. Think of it! I
stand for her going with other men, who support
her. Who could have told me that I would come to
this! Every little while I decide to break with her
and never see her again. I have sworn it to my wife,
who is heartbroken over the affair. But I am too
weak.... Save me! Free me from this terrible
plight! Restore me to my family.”</p>

<p>... This man’s life history is typical of the
neurotic. He understood sexual matters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
masturbated at a very early age. He began to
masturbate as early as the sixth year at school and
thinks that he can even trace the beginning of the
habit to an earlier date. He had many play mates
with whom he carried on the “usual childish games.”
These “usual childish games” turned out to be fellatio,
pederasty, manual onanism, and zoophily.
The children pressed into service a dog who by licking
the parts produced the highest orgasm in them.
The last homosexual love he carried on at 14 years
of age. He and a colleague performed mutual
masturbation. Once the two were warned against
the dangers of masturbation and they went together
to a house of prostitution. This they kept up for
a long time because it increased their satisfaction.
Often they exchanged their sexual partners. (This
is not an uncommon practice through which latent
homosexuals achieve a heightening of their orgasm
and cryptically reach after their male companion.
In houses of prostitution this practice is common
among friends.)</p>

<p>In a short time he developed into a genuine Don
Juan. At 16 years of age he had already become
a full-fledged woman hunter and succeeded in attracting
his high school professor’s wife as his
sweetheart. He went after every woman, young
or old, pretty or plain. He claims that old women
have yielded the highest pleasures and shows me a
letter in which <i>Franklin</i> advises young men to cling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to old women. But this pronounced gerontophiliac
tendency does not prevent him from having relations
with girls below age, almost children. His
whole thought, night and day, was concentrated
upon women. His first thought upon rising in the
morning usually was: “What adventures await me
today?” If he finds himself in a room with a
woman alone invariably he thinks: “How can I get
her?” Every woman he gets hold of he looks upon
merely as a means for gratification and soon tires of
her. With the exception of one elderly woman whom
he occasionally visits he has not kept up with any
woman longer than a few weeks. Often after the
first intercourse he feels disgust for his new sexual
partner and thinks to himself: “You are not any
different than the others!” Since his 16th year
he has had intercourse almost daily and often
several times a day. He was 32 years of age when
he first met his present wife. Her father was his
superior at the office, a man for whom he had the
very highest respect. (“There are not many
such men as he.”) He married the man’s
daughter, whom he held high in esteem high above
all others of her sex, and it was a very happy marriage.
His only fear was that his wife would find
out about his amorous escapades. For no woman
was safe near him and even during the early part of
their married life he kept up sexual relations with
their cook. Finally he managed to control himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
at least to the extent of avoiding any escapades
under his own roof so as to be more sure of keeping
his wife in ignorance of his amorous proclivities.
But he always kept on the string a lot of women
and girls who were at his disposal whenever he
wanted any of them.</p>

<p>He became acquainted with a young man whom
he liked a great deal. But there was one thing
about that young man which repelled him: he was
homosexual and proud of it. This was something
he could not understand and he endeavored very
zealously to rouse in his friend a love for women.
He failed completely; on the other hand his new
friend introduced him to the local homosexual circle,
in which he became interested merely as a “cultural
problem.” He frequented a café where homosexuals
were in the habit of congregating and noticed that
many among them were of pronounced intellectual
caliber. He was particularly impressed by the fact
that their common peculiarity levelled so completely
persons of different social standing. A
Count met a waiter or post office clerk as cordially
as he would a most intimate friend. A few weeks
later he met the sister of his new friend and fell
deeply in love with her at first sight. That was his
tremendous attachment.</p>

<p>It was plain that contact with the homosexuals
had released some of the inhibitions which had kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
back his own latent homosexuality and the latter
trait now threatened to overpower him. There was
but one safeguard against that, namely: flight into
love. The attachment to his friend became now a
passionate love for his friend’s sister, who resembled
her brother very closely. During coitus with his
new sweetheart it occurred to him early to give up
succubus, and to try the anal form of gratification,
and this produced in him tremendous orgasm such
as he had never before experienced.</p>

<p>His wife was informed through anonymous letters
of the state of affairs. Moreover he had become
very weak in his sexual relations with her and was
able to carry on his marital duties only with greatest
difficulty.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis brought wonderful results in this
case. He learned quickly to recognise his emotional
fixations and only wondered that he was too blind
not to have seen for himself that he really loved the
brother through that woman. He broke with the
actress in a dignified manner. He proposed that if
she should give up her intimate relations with all
other men he would keep his word and marry her.
He still loved her but he was no longer in the dark.
She laughed in his face. Did he really think that he
could meet the cost of her wardrobe and other needs?
That put an end to the attachment. He was
ashamed afterwards to think that he should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
preferred such a woman to his wife. The analysis
of a remarkable dream brought about the complete
severing of his infantile fixations.</p>

<p>The dream: <i>I am with Otto</i>—that was his friend’s
name—<i>in a room. He walks up to me and says:
“Don’t you see that I love you and want you!” I
try to avoid his love pats and draw a revolver out of
my pocket. I hold it high and am ready to shoot
my friend. But instead of my friend I see standing
before me my son, and my boy’s sincere blue eyes
look up at me imploringly: ‘Protect me!’ I throw
down the revolver and run out of the room.</i></p>

<p>His young friend resembled somewhat his boy to
whom he was specially devoted just before the unfortunate
love affair....</p>

<p>This case shows that sometimes a great and passionate
love arises to save the lover from himself.
There are times when it becomes necessary to love
and then the object of one’s love, though falling
short of the actual yearnings of one’s soul, becomes
emotionally overvalued so that the intoxication of
love leads to forgetfulness (like every other intoxication).
Any love affair which breaks out during
later life rouses the suspicion that it is an attempt
to save one’s self with all one’s might from homosexuality.
The characteristic signs of such a love
are its exaggerated and compulsory character. The
lovesick man is unable to keep away from his sweetheart;
he wants to have her by his side all the time;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
she must accompany him everywhere; even in sleep
he puts his hand out to his sweetheart as if to protect
him from every temptation. And I have seen
cases in which the curious infatuation was able to
withstand all opposition when it must be looked upon
as a successful healing process.</p>

<p>In the course of analysis it not infrequently happens
that those who call for advice transfer their
attachment to their consultant, feel tremendously
attached to him and in this state of emotional readiness
the first woman who happens along becomes the
object of their most intense love emotion as the
shortest way out of a sexual danger. The sexual
danger in question is homosexuality.</p>

<p>Don Juan, Cassanova, Retif de la Bretonne,—all
flee from man and seek salvation in woman. Retif
is a foot fetichist. The choice of this fetich,
typically bisexual, already indicates latent homosexuality.
Insatiable woman hunters often end their
flight away from homosexuality by falling into the
deepest neuroses.</p>

<p>The next case history illustrated this fact:</p>

<p>G. K., a prominent inventor, 32 years of age,
consults me for a number of <i>remarkable</i> compulsory
acts which he must always carry out before retiring
for the night. He must prove about twenty times
to make sure that the doors are all locked. Then
he goes through the house and submits every foot
of the place to the most painfully detailed and care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>ful
search to make sure that no burglar is hidden
anywhere. He looks not only under the beds but
into every box and drawer and closet, opening and
closing each one in turn, and very carefully. One
can never tell where a burglar may hide himself!
By the time he has concluded this search it is nearly
midnight. The terribly arduous procedure fatigues
him for he has to look everywhere, emptying even the
book cases in the course of his search for fear that
the burglar may be hidden back of the books, and it
is midnight when he crawls into bed, although he
begins his preparations around ten o’clock. Then
he is usually tormented with doubt whether he has
done everything. It occurs to him that he did not
go into the nursery at all, where his three children
are asleep. The boy’s room, too, has not been
searched. Jumping out of bed he lights a candle
and in his night toilette makes his way to the children’s
rooms, unable to rest any longer. The girls
are already accustomed to seeing him that way,
nevertheless they jump out of their sleep scared.
In his white nightgown, like a shadow, he moves
from place to place with lighted candle in hand,
looks under the children’s bed, under the servant
girl’s bed and incidentally makes sure that no man
lies by her side in bed. During these rounds every
door and every window is tried whether it is safely
locked. It is now long past midnight. Exhausted
he returns to his bed. Again various doubts begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
to torture him: did or did he not try this, or that,
or the other particular door, is the gasometer safely
turned off, and again in his thoughts he rehearses
every detail. His logical faculty tells him: you have
done everything, you need not have any further concern,
it is high time you went to sleep! But logic is
powerless when his doubts overpower him. Again
he rises and takes a few additional precautions which
I need not detail here. Thus it may be three or four
o’clock in the morning and even later before he is
finally through. Then he lies down in his wife’s
bed and wakes her up. Only after coitus, which he
carries out regularly every night, he falls asleep.
But by that time the night is over and the dawn is
just breaking. He remains in bed exhausted, often
sleeping till past the noon hour, much to his wife’s
disgust. The whole house is in uproar. The children
wake up but are taken to another wing of the
house because “papa is asleep and must not be
waked up!” As he is very wealthy, he has his way.
The servants are paid extra well so that they are
willing to put up with “that queer household.”
Afternoons he is at work in his chemical laboratory.
His researches have made him famous. He is a very
capable chemist, possessing wonderful ideas and
his patents have brought him a great fortune.</p>

<p>In addition to all that he is obsessed by another
compulsory thought, which seems very extraordinary.
Continually he wants to know how everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
likes his wife and whether she is still considered a
pretty woman. Regard for her appearance is his
greatest concern. Many afternoons he spends with
her in the fitting rooms of modistes and tailors. He
reproaches her for not knowing how to dress tastily,
and scolds her because she does not take proper
care of herself. On the other hand he is entirely
indifferent regarding the manner of her appearance
in the house. He is greatly concerned only with
the impression his wife makes upon other men. It
also disturbs him if other women do not find his wife
beautiful but he worries more if men fail to notice
her. As he dreads evenings he spends the time in
the company of friends. (Thus the ceremonial on
retiring is delayed and he sleeps to a late hour into
the day.)</p>

<p>His chief thought is his wife’s appearance. If a
man says to him: “Your wife is charming today!”
or if some stranger says to him: “Who is that beautiful
woman?” as has actually happened at balls and
entertainments he feels supremely happy. Or, if he
introduces his wife to some man who gallantly remarks
later: “I did not know that you had such a
charming wife!” his happiness knows no bounds
and his wife has a good time in consequence. The
very next day he buys her a costly gem, he is tender
with her and bestows upon her pleasant flatteries.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, if he sees that his wife
passes unobserved in a crowd, or if there is some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
other pretty woman in the room, he feels unhappy.
Then he meets his wife with severest reproaches because
she does not know how to dress attractively,
he growls, and raves, and is angry for several days
until another event takes place and his wife is
again noticed by men and women when he quiets
down. He cannot endure to hear that some other
man also has a pretty wife. He does not rest until
he meets that woman and is happy if some one says
to him: “Your wife is really prettier.” But if he
hears that another woman is praised and his wife
is not mentioned at same time he feels again very
depressed and his wife pays unpleasantly for it. His
uncles—he has no brothers—all have pretty women.
His chief concern is to find out whether his wife
is really the prettiest. He asks this question frequently
of his acquaintances, in an offhand manner
of course, for he would not have them suspect his
feelings for anything in the world and the opinion
of a man towards whom he is otherwise completely
indifferent often determines his disposition for the
whole day. He is happy if he notices that some
one is making love to his wife. On the other hand it
troubles him if he sees there are young men around
and they fail to gather around his wife. He is not
jealous because he knows his wife well, can trust her
and, besides, she is never alone. She is either with
him or in her mother’s company. That is why he
is very happy to see men gather around her. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
goes with her wherever any beauty contests are on
and spends a great deal of money to make sure
that his wife will win the prize. If another woman
is the winner it makes him unhappy and he genuinely
envies the man who possesses or will possess such
a woman.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, the man is a Don Juan and
was never true to his marital vows. He maintains
a second house where he receives girls and also such
of his friends’ wives as find favor in his eyes and
are willing to accept his attentions. As he is a well
preserved, stately man of most attractive appearance
he is very lucky with women.</p>

<p>Besides that he receives a number of girls in his
laboratory where he has fitted out a room for this
purpose. Not a day passes in which he does not
possess some woman—any woman—in addition to
his wife. He looks well, though occasionally a little
pale, feels physically very fresh and energetic. He
works really but two or three hours a day. In this
brief time he accomplishes more than other men in
a day’s grind.</p>

<p>The character of his sexual gratification is noteworthy.
While carrying out normal coitus with
his wife, with the girls and other women he indulges
in the kind of practices which furnish him the greatest
orgasm. He gives them his phallus which they
take hold of, and kisses them, <i>dum puella membrum
erectum tenet et premit</i>. He carries out coitus if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the partner requests it. But the act is interrupted
and again exchanged for hand manipulation. As
he is a very potent man, he is able to satisfy the
woman and still has time to withdraw his penis before
ejaculation and put it in the woman’s hand to
be manipulated by her. There have been also various
other indulgences. He has tried everything.
The form of gratification just mentioned he prefers
to all others. A certain feeling of shame has prevented
him from asking his wife to do it for him.</p>

<p>His anamnesis is very fragmentary. He remembers
no particular incidents of childhood or early
youth. He began to masturbate very early and up
to the time of his marriage masturbated regularly
every night before falling asleep. Already before
marriage he had had such compulsory habits, but
usually he was through his bed time searching in
about one half hour. At any rate he masturbated
daily even when he had intercourse with women. He
never took women to his house. They always came
to his laboratory. He is greatly attached to his
mother who is yet a very attractive woman and
shows great veneration for his father who brought
him up with strict but just discipline and who
showed some light neurotic peculiarities.</p>

<p>He recalls no homosexual episodes. He masturbated
excessively and began intercourse with women
at 18 years of age; after that he rapidly became a
confirmed woman hunter but he developed a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
particular taste. All his women had to be very fair,
have a pretty, round, strongly feminine figure, a
delicate tint and be, above all, very beautiful. Yet
a very white and smooth skin would make up for the
lack of other points of beauty in his eyes. With
the perfectly white face he required dark, fiery eyes.
This type of beauty seems to coincide with his
mother’s who was a remarkably attractive woman
and who to this day carries with great dignity the
obvious signs of her former great beauty.</p>

<p>He had also certain antifetichistic peculiarities.
If he notices hair on a woman’s body, for instance,
at once she loses all attractiveness in his eyes. Such
a woman he finds as disgusting as a woman with a
mustache. Equally disgusting to him are all
women with sharp figures and no breasts such as
remind one of a man. “A woman should be a
woman,” is his favorite remark. He despises all
“blue stockings” and emancipated women and has
requested his wife to drop the acquaintanceship of
a friend of hers who had taken an interest in various
women’s movements.</p>

<p>In the course of the analysis he refers continually
first of all to his wife. According to him he has
married an angel of patience. It takes great love
to endure this man’s moods and whims. But the
wife loves him devotedly and has learned to stand
everything from him because she knew that he loved
her and she said to herself: every man has his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
peculiarities. She was contented and the house
vibrated with her happy laughter. If he troubled
her with his foolish reproaches she did not pout for
long. On the contrary she soon smiled forgiveness
so that their married life was really a model.</p>

<p>He insists that his wife is an ideal person. When
early in the course of analysis one confesses such a
deep affection, the opposite feeling, scorn, is sure to
become disclosed before long. First the advantages,—then
the disadvantages. But this woman seemed
to have no unpleasant component in her nature. He
could tell only favorable things about her and about
his concern regarding her beauty.</p>

<p>But before long—in the course of a few weeks—the
tone of his talk changed. There was another
trauma about which he felt he must tell me, something
of tremendous significance which had shattered
his whole married life. At the time of his marriage
he had resolved nothing less than to give up his Don
Juan adventures and to be true to his wife. Just
before marriage he had been carrying on with six
different girls at the same time and it kept him on
the jump to keep each woman from finding out about
the others. He wanted to live quietly after marriage
and be true to his wife. He had also resolved
solemnly to give up masturbation after marriage.
As a married man this would be easy,—instead of
masturbating before going to sleep he would have
intercourse with his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Before the marriage ceremony he became obsessed
with the thought that his bride might have hair growing
on her breasts. That would be unbearable. He
was on the point of demanding that his bride should
be examined by a physician but, as a man of high
standing, he was ashamed to make such a suggestion.
During the bridal night he discovered a few
light hairs on her breast and a light soft down on
her abdomen. He was so shocked that he would
have wanted to send her back to her parents. For
months after that he was very unhappy and every
night he wept over his misfortune. His great hope,
to find a woman who would take the place of all
other women in his life, was gone.</p>

<p>This notion about his wife’s hairs made him most
unhappy and prevented his moral resurrection. He
had planned to turn a new leaf. But he continued
to feel himself irresistibly attracted to beautiful
white women with marble-like smooth skin and no
hair to remind one of a man’s body.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature, characteristic of
the whole case is the fact last mentioned.</p>

<p>The man is avowedly bisexual with a strong leaning
towards homosexuality. This homosexual trend
was gratified up till that time through masturbation—as
he has pointed out. He sought contact with
fully developed women, to forget man. He wanted
a very beautiful wife because he imagined her beauty
would serve to drive away from him all thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
man and to focus his libido exclusively upon her.
He wanted to have the prettiest woman in the world:
Helen. If his wife’s appearance pleased other men,
this so roused the homosexual component of his libido
that he enjoyed sexual intercourse with her more
keenly. Above all he wanted to avoid the thought of
man. The anxiety on account of man came over
him particularly before retiring at night and it was
a morbid anxiety over masturbation at the same
time. In his head, within his brain, man was a living
thought, something that threatened him and demanded
release. But this was also something his
consciousness refused to recognize and therefore the
thought of man tortured him and he could not fall
asleep. He projected this intruder into his room
and it led him to search his empty closets for a non-existent
man, as if saying to himself: I have no
trace of any homosexual leaning whatever! That
is what he actually told me when I referred to the
homosexual significance of his compulsory acts:
such a Don Juan as I! I have devoted myself completely
to woman. The thought of man is repulsive
to me.</p>

<p>I explained to him that disgust is but a hidden
form of longing. If he were indifferent to the
thought of man it would be more convincing.</p>

<p>“Well then, I am indifferent to the thought.”</p>

<p>Thus he tried to convince me that he was not
homosexual. But we conceive that the hairs he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
discovered upon his wife’s body reminded him of the
fatal homosexuality. He felt so unhappy over it
he was considering a separation on that account.
Whatever reminded him of man was painfully unpleasant
to him. He threw himself into love adventures
to forget man. He gave up his clubs and
male companions because he wanted to be all the
time in the company of his wife.</p>

<p>I pass over for the present the further significance
of his neurosis as disclosed by the analysis of his
dreams. I shall only give an example illustrating
how untrustworthy are the statements of those who
attempt to give an account of their lives and insist
that they remember everything accurately. This or
that particular kind of incident, they are sure, has
never occurred in their life. Regarding sexual matters
all men lie consciously, unconsciously and half-consciously.</p>

<p>After further, continuously progressive analysis
the subject himself came to the conclusion that he
must have been struggling against homosexuality.
Now he understood his sudden decision to get married,
after having maintained right along that he
would remain a bachelor. He was interested at the
time in a laboratory assistant, a young man with
pretty rosy cheeks. He showered gifts upon that
young man and planned to give him an education so
as to have a friend always close to him. The first
compulsory acts appeared at the time. He married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
felt unhappy for a time but for a few years he lived
at least a relatively quiet life. Then another man
came into his life destroying his peace of mind, a
man who had lived for some time in foreign countries
and now returned to his fatherland. This was an
uncle.</p>

<p>Now he recalls something of which he had not
thought for many years—for he was going to keep
this from me,—namely, that he had maintained certain
intimacy with this uncle for about a year. They
lived in a boarding house where they occupied a room
together. The uncle always came to lie in his bed
and they played with each other before falling
asleep.</p>

<p>His uncle carried out the kind of manipulations
which he now required of his women lovers: manual
gratification. During his relations with his wife,
however, he wanted to avoid all thought of homosexuality;
she should not practice this form of gratification
for him nor should her body remind him of
homosexuality. She must save him of the burden of
homosexuality which still plagued him under the
form of onanism.</p>

<p>After resurrecting this memory a mass of other
homosexual data came trooping forth out of his
past.</p>

<p>This man was strongly bisexual from childhood
with particular predisposition towards the male sex.
As a child he did crocheting and showed various fe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>male
characteristics. After the onset of puberty
his homosexuality was strongly repressed, persisting
chiefly under the guise of onanism. For the act
of masturbation takes place just before falling
asleep in a half dreamy state during which he thinks,
though indistinctly, of his uncle and of other men.
The latent homosexuality was the most important
factor in his neurosis.</p>

<p>The result of the analysis was most gratifying in
this case. The subject soon abandoned his compulsory
acts and was able to sleep quietly. His life
became regular; he ceased being a Don Juan. He
allowed his wife to carry out those manipulations
which seemed essential for his orgasm and for his
peace of mind. Occasionally I see him.</p>

<p>These observations show that in the dynamics of
the “polygamic neurosis,” homosexuality plays a
tremendous role. The observation that every love is
really self-love receives new confirmation. Don
Juan seeks himself in woman and finds in her that
femininity which has turned him into a Don Juan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his book (<i>Don Juan, Cassanova and other
Erotic Characters</i>) already mentioned (Stuttgart,
1906), <i>Oskar A. H. Schmitz</i> states:</p>

<p>“Cassanova would not begrudge woman the possession
of all those traits which are called ‘male,’
through ignorance, just as he himself has been described
as possessing many female traits. The di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>vision
of mankind in men and women is a great convenience.
But he who undertakes to investigate
erotic problems to their bottom must bear in mind
that there are no absolute male and female persons
any more than there are persons who are purely
quick tempered, good-natured, envious, Germans or
Semites. All these designations, like Theophrast’s
characters, represent so many psychic elements
which must have a name. But they are met only in
various combinations which may be compared and
contrasted with chemical combinations. I believe it
is noticeable that men of overstressed virility do not
necessarily appeal to women, who find them, instead,
partly repulsive, partly amusing. On the other
hand it is certainly true that all female tempters
were remarkable for their intellect and wit—some of
them were veritable amazons intellectually—and we
note in our own day with great reason the disappearance
of the “<i>crampon</i>” together with the leaning
instinct of Epheus. Even the disappearance of Don
Juan may be due partly to his overstressed virile
characteristics. The erotic temperament includes a
number of female traits; such peculiarities as tenderness,
vanity, talkativeness need not interfere with his
amorous adventures.”</p>

<p>The last case has shown us that cryptic sexual
goals which remain hidden make for unrest and in
spite of frequent sexual experiences bring about a
state of sexual insatiety, endless hunger, longing
and unrest. Man’s unsatisfied instinct drives him
like a motor to all sorts of symbolic acts; it induces
him to taste all gratifications which are not under
the sway of inhibition, robbing him of sleep and rest.</p>

<p>All the symptomatic acts we have mentioned, trying
the doors,—looking under the bed, etc.—were
due to the subject’s fear of homosexuality. The
doors of his soul must be hermetically sealed so that
the terrible enemy should find no entry.</p>

<p>The subject also displayed a number of other
symptomatic acts which richly symbolized his inversion.
He turned around certain objects from the
left to the right. He felt more satisfied after doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
so. Why did he do it? Because in consciousness
the right side always stands for what is permitted,
while the left symbolizes the forbidden. Some things
he turned around and upside down to see whether
they would keep their balance. If they tumbled it
filled him with uneasiness, if they stood up, he felt
satisfied. Occasionally he found a vessel that kept
its balance when turned upside down. But he was
satisfied if it did not break.</p>

<p>His phantasy played with the possibility of turning
sexuality upside down. If the change involved no
mishap it carried to him the meaning: even if you are
homosexual, you need not lose your balance, you
can keep up and stand on your feet. After such
a symbolic act he experienced promptly erection and
ran to his wife who only disappointed him because
she did not gratify him enough. These men have a
strong yearning for great heterosexual passion
which shall make them forget their homosexuality.
Usually imagination comes to their aid and they find
women who give them so much spiritually, that they
overlook the absence of physical attractiveness.
They sublimate their homosexuality, heighten the
meaning of sexuality by endowing it with spiritual
erotism, and by means of spiritual ecstacy they make
up for the lack of physical lure.</p>

<p>If this transposition does not take place, if the
flame blazes only upon the physical sphere, a permanent
love hunger becomes established known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
satyriasis. This condition must be differentiated
from priapism which is caused solely by organic conditions
and consists of a more or less continuous
state of erection.</p>

<p>Priapism is often brought about by diseases of
the <i>corpora cavernosa</i>, by diabetes and diseases of
the spinal cord, and is a condition very unpleasant
to the sufferer. Here the instinct is not brought
into play, the excited organ requires nothing,—it
is merely unwell. The psychic impulse is entirely
lacking. The subjects feel their condition as something
painfully unpleasant, they cohabit merely to
get rid of the troublesome erection. On the other
hand, the victim of satyriasis is continually impelled
to seek gratification and it often happens that he
is unable to carry on intercourse because erection
fails him. The impulse is psychic rather than physical.
Satyriasis is an attempt to exhaust a psychic
impulse through the physical channel. A transference
of priapism into the psychical sphere, that is,
the establishment of a disposition along this path
on the basis of a priapistic excitation, is something
I have not encountered.</p>

<p>Satyriasis may be produced in a number of ways.
We have seen already that persons with sadistic
fancies, necrophiliac tendencies and with all sorts
of infantile misophilias may be addicted to masturbation.
In all these cases, if onanism is given up, a
condition develops resembling satyriasis. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
these persons seek is a transference of their libido
upon the normal path. At the same time my observations
enable me to declare that the various conditions
mentioned are overshadowed by the significance
of latent homosexuality. The most important
as well as the most powerful driving force is homosexuality.
But I also know of a homosexual in
whom the latent heterosexuality has broken forth as
a satyriasis directed along homosexual channels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We shall now turn our attention to a case which
illustrates many of these points:</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred V., clerk, 26 years of age, complains
of a long array of nervous symptoms. In the first
place there is his inability to attend to his work. He
is without employment, because he is unable to hold
on to any place. He cannot concentrate his thoughts
as his mind turns all the time to women.</p>

<p>In the morning, as soon as he wakes up, his first
thought is: I could enjoy a woman now! He thinks
this over and finds that, after all, it is too early in
the day. He goes to the restaurant and there looks
over the morning papers. It is almost too much
for him to do even that. Usually he only glances
over the news of the day and then turns to the want
ads, particularly those marriage offers and “personals”
with more or less pointed allusions. Several
hours pass that way and meanwhile he looks
at the women passing by the window. Then he takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
a walk and tries to talk to the girls he meets and to
strike up acquaintance with them. If he finds that
they are after money he breaks up his talk with
them. He would rather take a real prostitute than
pay a half-prostitute. Occasionally he finds a girl
who meets his wishes. Then he goes with her to a
hotel, although it is still forenoon. For a short time
after that he is more quiet and he even feels that he
could work an hour or two. But soon his restlessness
seizes him again which is always at first a purely
psychic urge. It is not erections that trouble him,
but craving and unrest. He attains erection only
when he is with the <i>puella</i>. His <i>potentia</i> varies.
Sometimes he is through very rapidly, sometimes he
requires a half hour before he accomplishes erection
and orgasm. Again he may indulge in coitus several
times in succession, although he feels quieted down
after the first.</p>

<p>This condition he naturally describes as painful
and unpleasant. He tries to interest himself in art
and science, as other men do; he would also like to
carry on intellectual conversations. But he can only
think of “obscenities” to talk about. The more
foolish and cynical the better he likes them. He
feels impelled to use the grossest expressions, especially
before prostitutes and doing so brings him
great pleasure.</p>

<p>He also has fits of anger during which he is almost
beside himself. If something is not to his liking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
it makes him raving mad. At such times he is likely
to break out with violence, for instance, destroy a
chair, or hurl things through the window regardless
of the danger of striking some passer-by, and he
may say the most awful things to his landlady. He
has had many quarrels and violent scenes have been
caused on account of his uncontrollable temper.</p>

<p>For some months he kept a fairly good job but
had to quit because he talked back to his office chief,
using bad language. It always made him mad to
have work piled up on him. Work is a red rag
to him. He found on his desk twenty letters which
had to be done. Instead of settling down to work
he began swearing. What did the folks think anyway?
How did they expect one man to do it all?
The very impertinence! etc. After several hours of
fuming that way he fell to his work. Then everything
was all right and he got through fast enough
for he always finished his work before all others in
the office.</p>

<p>He wondered that he was not dismissed from that
office long before. His chief had the patience of
an angel. Finally even that man’s patience was
exhausted and he was discharged. After that he
could find no permanent employment. He kept a
job a few days at a time; then the chip on his
shoulder would cause him to be discharged.</p>

<p>He related his sexual life in great detail; of particular
importance is his statement that he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
had anything to do with homosexuals; though he
well knew there are homosexuals. Such folks were
“beasts” who inspired him only with disgust....</p>

<p>We allow here Alfred to speak for himself. In
the account of his life there are a number of observations
which are characteristic of the whole man:</p>

<p>“I remember nothing of my early childhood.
What happened during that time I cannot recollect;
my earliest memories date from the time when I was
already in school. I only know that both parents
were nervous. I lost one brother early, I know
nothing of the circumstances. There were a number
of insanities in our family, especially on father’s
side.</p>

<p>“My sexual feelings asserted themselves at a very
early age. I remember that when I was seven years
old I played with myself before father, without any
feeling of shame, because I did not know that it was
wrong. Father scolded me and forbade me doing
this. But his threats only had the effect of forcing
me to continue under cover what I tried to do openly
before him. I believe that my power of concentration
and my ability to work were impaired already
at that time. From playing I merged quickly into
systematic masturbation, a habit in which I indulged
excessively. At ten years of age we had at school
a regular ring of masturbators and we carried on all
sorts of things jointly. Nor did we limit ourselves
to manual handling....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“At about that time I had terrible nightmares. I
saw wild animals, was overcome or bitten by them,
thieves wanted to kidnap me, and in my dreams I
often saw my father coming after me with a great
long stick. These nightly dreams tortured me considerably,
every night I was feverish and bathed in
sweat.</p>

<p>“In the morning I had an ‘all gone’ feeling. I
gazed blankly before me at school always holding
my hand on the penis,—in fact, I often masturbated
during class. I became less and less able to concentrate
on the work or to carry on my school tasks.
In various ways I attempted first to keep up with
the work and then I tried all sorts of makeshifts to
avoid my school duties. As early as at that age it
was characteristic of me that what interested me I
had no difficulty in doing. I learned easily but only
subjects which I was not taught in school. Thus,
for instance, as a boy I became interested in
mineralogy, astronomy and botany, and I acquired
quite a fund of information on these topics. I
should have never learned a hundredth part of what
I knew about the subjects if they had been drilled
into me at school.... Everything that was a duty
seemed unbearable to me. Work was a hard duty
and always unpleasant. Therefore I got along
rather poorly in school. I reached the status of a
one-yearling (the privilege to do but one year military
duty) only with the aid of home coaching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
by the use of influence. And I attained that privilege
only at the last moment, during my twentieth
year, when I faced the danger of having to serve
three years. In a few weeks I prepared and
crammed, so as to pass my examinations because I
knew that, unless I did, I would be in trouble. I
always went to extremes that way, the midway never
appealed to me. I would pour over my astronomical
books for five hours at a stretch or devote myself
uninterruptedly to my plants and my collection of
stones, but if I spent a half hour upon my school
lessons it made me mad and in my fury I tore the
note book.</p>

<p>“My memory for past events is poor. But some
incidents, here and there, I recall very vividly. For
instance, I remember nothing of a journey through
Thuringen which I made with my uncle when I was
ten years of age. I was like in a trance during that
journey. I made that same journey a second
time and then I recalled of one spot that I had
already been there. There was a stone there
where I had tripped and fallen during the first
journey.</p>

<p>“As a boy I was often punished for my laziness
and I was even strapped for my obstinacy. I
thought I was treated unjustly for I considered my
lack of concentration as something I could not help.
I was always restless, perennially moody, sometimes
very joyous and again very depressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Masturbation I carried on excessively. I masturbated
daily—seldom a day passed,—sometimes
several times daily, up to the 21st year, when I first
had intercourse. Then I decided to give up onanism.
At first I had only normal intercourse and felt great
satisfaction. But I had to do it very often or my
nerves would be all to pieces. During my military
service I felt excellently well. I endured easily all
sorts of physical exertion and I was very proud of
my uniform. As I am very tall and well built I attracted
attention in my uniform and the girls looked
at me and this made me very proud. But I continued
masturbating at the time and avoided intercourse.
During the service I was often nervous when I had
to carry out an order or if I was kept at one station
for any length of time. I pressed myself forward
wherever I could, and finally a horse kicked me and
I used that accident as a chance to be freed of the
service and received for some time the accident pay
granted under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“If I am able to get the best of some one, especially
of some one in authority, it pleases me beyond
measure.</p>

<p>“After the military service I took a position. As
I had intercourse daily with women I was in good
condition to keep up my work. But I could not
endure to have two tasks piled up on me at the
same time. I could do only one thing at a time. I
was not easy to get along with and had to change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
positions because I quarreled with my chiefs and
because I always avoided hard work. Then I came
to Vienna and got a place which I kept for some
time. The business interested me, because it dealt
with an article which appealed to me. Here I began
to grow restless and my uneasiness increased when
we removed to Berlin. Normal intercourse no longer
satisfied me. I became acquainted with a French
woman who became my sweetheart and with whom I
practiced all sorts of perversities. I became more
and more unstable in my work, often neglecting it
for hours at a stretch. I do not know whether that
was on account of the Berlin air, which did not
agree with me, or because of an accident I met with
on the railway. I gave up my position, that is, my
chief advised me to do so, although it was a responsible
position of great trust, of which I was
very proud, especially as my father had bonded me
heavily. But I grew more and more restless, it
drove me continually to women. I had nothing else
on my mind and I wracked my brain to think of
new, unheard of perversities to try out. I even tried
<i>podicem lambere</i> and for a time this brought me
great satisfaction, but it quieted me only for a few
hours. Then I turned again to Friedrichstrasse
looking for the other girls I kept on string besides
my regular sweetheart. These adventures required
a great deal of money, only a part of which I was
able to earn at the time. It was to me always a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
pleasant thought that father had to pay for my
indulgences.</p>

<p>“My unrest reached its highest point when my
father came to Berlin to see me and I lived in
Charlottenburg. I had a formidable anxiety about
meeting him and so it happened that he was mostly
alone and saw me but seldom. He did prevail upon
me to see a specialist who promptly put me in a
sanitarium. While there I was much more quiet,
but only outwardly. Within me the old struggle
kept on as usual. The physician ordered me to give
up women for a time because I was super-excitable
and indulgence would harm me. I was abstinent for
a few weeks but thoughts troubled me every night
and I was plainly afraid of losing my mind. Then
I turned to my old remedy, onanism. I did this in
spite of the fact that the physician and the specialist
both declared that my condition was due to
excessive masturbation. I was torn between conflicting
thoughts at the time but noticed that I became
more quiet after masturbating. At any rate
after three months of sanitarium treatment I was
still in no condition to work. I am depressed and
life loses its zest the moment I turn to work. After
the first few minutes my mind turns to women and I
must interrupt whatever I am doing and run into the
street. Leaving the sanitarium I returned to Vienna
where the old vicious cycle began once more. I made
the round of physicians and was given any quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
of bromides. Neither the medicines nor the various
hydrotherapic courses helped me in any way. Only
if I have intercourse about three times during the
night do I feel a little quieted down in the morning.
Then I am a little more alert and can work for a
short while. But already on the following day,
usually the first thing in the morning, the old trouble
reasserts itself. I am irritable and depressed. After
a coitus which does not gratify me I feel worse than
ever. Then I am tremendously excited and want
right away another woman who might satisfy me
better. Sometimes I long for true love and for the
companionship of a lovely being. I then feel the
terror of loneliness fastening upon me. I literally
pant for air and again rush to the street where
temptations meet me. I feel as if something within
me has taken possession of my soul driving me on
from one adventure to another. Personally I am
inwardly inclined towards everything that is noble;
but something within me compels me to act as a bad
and evil person.</p>

<p>“I believe I am like a man who is the victim of
an insatiable hunger. I have often thought of poor
Prometheus, condemned always to linger in hunger
and thirst. In the same way I feel within me an
unquenchable thirst for love and its pleasures and
I have no other thought than to satisfy this thirst
in some way. I feel like a mechanism destined only
to serve the penis in its demand for gratification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“I have often resolved to change. But I am unable
to carry out any resolution, I cannot undertake
a thing. I can only hunt after women. <i>Ich kann
nur coitieren</i>, (I can only ——,) every other
activity about me is in a state of suspension. I am
uncertain and vaccilating about everything. Today
I feel a little religious twinge, tomorrow I poke fun
at church and priest. Today I decide to learn
something new or to find a job, tomorrow I think
something else entirely. I want to buy a new hat.
I decide today to go to a certain store. I go to
the place but linger before the windows, unable to
make up my mind to step in. “No,” I say to myself,
“I don’t want to buy a hat just yet.” And
meanwhile I also think about women for that is a
subject which never leaves my mind for a moment.
I stroll up and down the street watching the hundreds
of women before I make up my mind to speak
to one.</p>

<p>“I draw no distinction between old and young,
pretty or plain ones. I weigh the matter over considerably
but in the end I pick up the first one that
comes along. If it only quieted me! But it lasts
only an hour, sometimes, at best, a whole day, then
I must rush out again to the street and hunt. Sometimes
I cohabit with three women in a day.</p>

<p>“My worst time was when I had gonorrhea (not
yet completely healed). I was forbidden to have
intercourse for a time. But I could not listen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the doctor, because I was afraid that I would go
literally to pieces. I kept up intercourse right along
and was inwardly glad to think that so many others
will also have to suffer what I suffered. Then I
felt remorse over my meanness, I felt myself a reprobate,
a criminal, and resolved that I must change
my ways. I fell into a deep depression and for a
few hours I was free of my usual erotic thoughts.
Then they started again and the same thoughts now
plague me night and day as before.” ...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have listened to the poor man’s terrible confession.
His hunt after gratification has that
tragical quality which the poet has so fittingly expressed:
“<i>Und im Genuss verschmacht’ ich nach
Begierde.</i>”—“And I starved with yearning even
while I tasted.” The deep depressions indicate that
this trouble is approaching a crisis. For the depressions
occur at closer intervals and satisfying experiences
are more rare. That is also the reason why
he seeks professional advice. He feels that this
cannot go on. He cannot and does not want to
endure life under such conditions. He wants to work
like other men and to be capable of turning his mind
to other matters than sexual.</p>

<p>Two things stand out in the patient’s account.
First, his complete amnesia regarding his first journey
through Thuringen, as pointed out by himself—except
for the slight accident of tripping—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
next, the fact that his condition became so much
more serious during his stay in Berlin, when he was
already on the way to get well. He had given up
masturbation of his own initiative, substituting for
it intercourse with women, he was working, he held a
responsible position, and kept up his work, according
to the statement of his superiors in office, in
spite of disturbances ... then suddenly his condition
made a turn for the worse. Some strong impression
or unusual experience in Berlin must have
brought on this sudden change.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the subject denies having
ever carried on any homosexual act. He claims such
men only fill him with extreme disgust. The childhood
experiences, of course, do not count. All children
did the same things; one would conclude that
all boys were homosexual. As a matter of fact they
are married and happy, most of them heads of happy
families. “I have a frightful passion,” he says, “exclusively
for women. Men do not exist for me.”</p>

<p>At night he dreams:</p>

<p><i>I see a turbulent ocean before me. The waves are
in continuous agitation. I think to myself: it were a
pity if the waves ceased their agitation. A ship
passes by, and the boat carries everything that I
love. I believe my mother is also upon that ship.
There is an orchestra playing on board: “Oh, how
could I possibly leave you!” I awake feeling sad and
depressed.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Such a dream is a resistance dream and indicates
that the subject does not want to get well. His
soul is an ocean, continuously in a state of agitation.
“I think it a pity that the waves should cease,”
means: <i>I do not want to become quiet at all!</i> The
boat symbolizes the illness, the neurosis. His neurosis
covers everything he loves, including his
mother; and should he give up all that? Impossible!
He cannot renounce his infantile sexuality.
He wants to remain a child and be ill.</p>

<p>The analysis is carried out under very great resistance
but satisfactory progress is made. I want
to outline the results limiting myself to the most
important points.</p>

<p>His sexual life comes more and more to light. It
appears that in his free account he covered under
silence a important form of pleasurable gratification
because he was ashamed of it. He indulges in
a very curious form of infantile sexuality. The
habit must be widespread but in this form I have met
it only twice.</p>

<p>Every two weeks he does as follows: he lies down
in bed dressed in his underclothes and defecates.
Then he lies in his stools for several hours. After
that he takes great pains to remove every trace.
He washes the drawers and the shirt or he burns
them up. At the baths, where he is always very
excited sexually he does the same thing. He does
that there more readily because the means are at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
hand for cleaning himself afterwards. He usually
takes along a package of clean linen. At the public
baths every cabin has a couch. He lies down and
allows his bowels to move. There he lies feeling very
satisfied and masturbates or has a spontaneous
ejaculation. Then he bathes to clean himself and
the package of soiled linen he throws into a river
or anywhere where it disappears quickly.</p>

<p>In these scenes he reproduces the infant in swaddling
clothes. He even presses the covers tightly
around him so that he cannot move, to give himself
the illusion of being tied down. He repeats the
infantile scenes of cleaning by the mother, during
which in his fancy he plays the double role of mother
and child.</p>

<p>He struggles with greatest anxiety against this
remarkable paraphila but always submits to it in
the end. The longest interval up to the time of the
psychoanalysis was four weeks. After that “orgy
of filth,”—as he calls it—he feels depressed and is
ashamed of himself. He has not mentioned this to a
living soul and even the physician at the sanitarium
knew nothing about it. He went through this act
several times not at the sanitarium, but in his room
because the baths were not private. When discussing
sexual infantilism we shall learn of several similar
cases. His attitude towards his mother is very
changeable but not so emotionally tense as his relations
with his father. He carries on a quiet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
occasionally affectionate exchange of letters with
his mother, but with his father, never. He is to a
certain extent fond of his mother. As he tried masturbation
in front of his father as a child so now
he keeps nothing of his sexual life secret before me.
He relates frankly everything. As a child he loved
his mother very much and often wished to be with
her. His mother is now an old woman, partially
paralysed. Nevertheless he noticed during his last
visit home that she is still a pretty woman and repeatedly
felt impelled to approach her.... At
such times he treats her very roughly and scornfully,
and is inclined to make fun of her and her age.
He has had repeatedly affairs with old women. At
his last lodging place there was an elderly woman,
whose face was badly wrinkled, with whom he became
intimate but after a short time he sought a
quarrel with her and moved out. That is the way
he behaves with everybody. He quarrels over some
trifle, becomes very excited and makes a terrible
scene. Then he is through with that person for
good.</p>

<p>We shall see that this is his way of protecting
himself against temptation. He quarrels only with
persons with whom he has pleasant relations and
who play some role in his sexual fancies. That is
also how he parts from his mother, for he usually
leaves her after a bitter quarrel. This is also why
his parents let him dwell among strangers, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
they think a great deal of him. His letters are sufficiently
irritating but easier to endure than the
scenes he creates when at home.</p>

<p>His attitude towards his father is worse. He is
easily moved to anger when speaking of him. He
makes copious use of vile terms when referring to
him. Such expressions as “the old rascal,” the
“miserable thief,” are customary with him when
speaking of his father. He knows no reason why he
should feel so bitter towards his father. That is,
he gives a thousand reasons but all trivial and hardly
relevant. The father brought him up badly; the
father is responsible for his condition; the father is
wealthy, nevertheless complains always that he has
nothing; the father lives only for his mother and
cares nothing for <i>him</i>. He wants to make himself
independent and wants to get money from his father
for that purpose. The very thought that his father
may deny him the money makes him angry: “I shall
go to him and kill him and shoot myself.” Such
murder fancies are not infrequent about his father.</p>

<p>How close the neurotic is to the criminal! Against
his father he raises all sorts of complaints, equally
unreasonable. One day he called on me to say that,
having passed a sleepless night he has figured out at
last the reason for his illness: the father has murdered
his brother! The brother was incurably ill
and a burden to his father. He knew it well and had
decided to go home and confront his father with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
the truth, then demand his share of the inheritance.
Even as a boy it was clear to him that the father
had deliberately put his brother out of the way.
The father always felt uncomfortable when the talk
turned to the boy and always tried to avoid the
subject.</p>

<p>He judges his father according to his own inner
self. He carries within himself the soul of a murderer,
as the pathologic strength of his instinctive
cravings already indicates. The suspicion directed
against his father is determined psychically by the
fact that during his own youth he wished his
brother’s death because he did not want to have any
competitor for household favors and he knew well
that the fortune would have to be divided between
them. But he was not the kind of man who would
consent to dividing anything. He wanted everything
for himself exclusively. He wanted his brother
out of the way and had actually indulged in various
fanciful dreams how to go about it. Now he
shifted his fancies over to his father, while for himself
he conjured up an attitude of sympathy and
regret whenever his brother was mentioned. He is
most unhappy because he has no brother, his father
has robbed him of what was most precious in his
life. Had his brother lived he would not be ill, only
the realization of his father’s deed is what brought
him to such a state. The father passes for a prominent
person and enjoys a high position in his com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>munity,
he has been mayor of the town, but should
he start proceedings against him, the father would
land in jail. He is filled with jealousy because his
father has done so well; his own incapacity he explains
away chiefly on the score of his illness.</p>

<p>It takes a long time for the original love of the
father to come to the surface, back of this thick
cover of hatred and jealousy. But the masking layer
melts, surely though slowly, and meanwhile explanations
for which the subject is as yet unprepared
would do more harm than good. The art of analysis
consists in showing up only so much as reveals
itself from time to time. Our subject is not yet
prepared to see that he is in love with his father.
Nevertheless he begins to talk about his father’s
preeminence and other favorable sides, the man’s
knowledge, his great library, etc.</p>

<p>Gradually the father’s picture looms up in terms
more and more favorable. The subject relates pleasant
episodes from youth, when he botanized along
with his father who introduced him to the science;
he withdraws his murder notion, admitting at last
that it was only part of his over-heated fancy. At
this stage when he takes me for the <i>locum tenens</i>
of his father, he assumes an aggressive attitude
towards me and uses an expression which amounts
to an insult. I had already made clear to him that
he sees his father in me. Now he undertakes to treat
me as he would his father. At once I break up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
analysis. Three days later he returns remorsefully
and begs forgiveness. It will not happen again, I
must not leave him in the lurch, he cannot stand this
condition any longer, and I must save him. That
was the only conflict I ever had with him; after that
he behaved well and to this day he shows himself
appreciative and filled with gratitude. He was ready
to recognize how strongly his homosexuality determined
his attitude towards his superiors, towards
his father, as well as towards me. He now sees it
clearly. He admits he practically fell in love with
his last chief and that is why he had to quit the
place. He relates a dream which he had kept to
himself till then, and which shows his homosexual
attitude towards me, and admits that during childhood
he had idealized his father and loved him
deeply.</p>

<p>We learn more than that. We find out what
brought on his turn for the worse at Berlin. At
his lodging house there was a young boy 14 years
of age, very attractive, whom he coached evenings.
He began to play with that boy. He masturbated
him and was masturbated by the boy in turn. The
relationship kept up for about three months. These
were the first three months of his stay in Berlin.
Then he felt remorse, sought a quarrel with the landlady
and moved out. From that moment began his
insatiable craving for women. It was his last homosexual
period. He had led astray other boys before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
that one and always gladly introduced them to the
habit. A court case in which the defendant was
sentenced for a similar offence decided him to give
up the homosexual practices. He never repeated
them after that Berlin episode.</p>

<p>His satyriasis developed on account of the repression
of his homosexual tendencies. Back of his
morbid passion for woman stood his ungratified
longing for man.</p>

<p>The subject now sees clearly that he carried on
with the boy the act which he expected of his father.
His hatred of the father is reversed love. In the
chapter devoted to sadism we will describe more
fully this relationship between father and son.</p>

<p>Our subject expected his father to do with him
what he did with the boy. It shows how little
credence we should lend a patient’s first statements.
Presently numerous similar episodes come to the
forefront and soon we learn that his greatest desire
at one time was to procure a pretty boy for himself
and that boys roused him more than girls. He seeks
the company of women to forget all about his inclination
towards boys and hopes to overcome his
homosexual tendencies through excessive heterosexual
experiences. His craving for women, his
obsessive thinking about them, serves only as a means
to prevent his mind from reverting to the other sex.
Compulsory thoughts often serve the purpose of
preventing other thoughts from intruding. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the law of resistance which plays such a tremendous
role in the mental life of neurotics. In the course
of treatment he transfers upon me all his passion—as
was to be expected. He has some dreams,—which
he relates with great difficulty,—during which
he sees me naked and handles my penis or even carries
out <i>fellatio</i>. He now recalls passionately watching
his father, also how happy he was to go bathing
with him, and how he liked to hide in order to see
his father’s phallus. The dissolution of this transference
and reference back to his father he does not
like at first, but it becomes more and more pronounced
as we proceed. He is now abstinent for a
week at a stretch and no longer chases after women
although I gave him no particular advice on this
point. The consciously acknowledged homosexual
leaning has no need for this cover. As leaning
comes to surface openly it is openly overcome. He
again experiences anxieties. His landlady tells that
he is heard tossing and groaning and even crying
out in his sleep. He is now sentimental and soft,
becoming greatly changed in character, to his advantage.
Again he goes to the theatre and reads
books,—things he had not done for years. His
letters to his father are more quiet in tone and
sympathetic. He becomes economical and spends
less than his father sends him.</p>

<p>Then something happens which promises to mark
a new epoch in his life. It is a typical experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of these men during treatment. As the infantile
ties are loosened in the course of the analysis they
fall in love.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Our subject is in a state of highest preparedness
towards love. His homosexuality, which had been
completely repressed—he no longer took any interest
in boys—was again manifest. He now played his
trump card. He fell in love with a girl who was to
replace for him all other women as well as all thought
of man. This happened in so remarkable and typical
a manner that it is worth while to report fully
the occurrence.</p>

<p>He was still in the habit of accosting girls on
the street, even if for no other object than sheer
amusement. One evening he came across a demure
little girl who looked rather like a young boy, boldly
spoke to her and fell deeply in love with her on the
spot. In three days he declared himself her beau
and six days later they became engaged. He thought
of nothing else but his sweetheart. As if bent on
revenging himself on me and on his father he spoke
of nothing else but his love and his new found happiness.
The satyriasis was replaced by a psychic intoxication
even more powerful. He picked up a
girl belonging to an ordinary family to punish his
parents. He chose that girl although she was no
longer <i>virgo intacta</i> (because this did not interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
him). He told that to his parents and it was, he
felt, the strongest revenge and punishment he could
bring upon them. They thought a great deal of
their social position; and now, their son was marrying
the daughter of a motorman, a girl without any
education and who served as clerk in some store.
And he threatened his parents that he would take his
life unless he could marry the girl. He would marry
her without their consent. His love was so great,—such
a love never had its equal in the world! The
very thought that his father might try to prevent
the marriage made him raving mad and he talked of
violence and murder.</p>

<p>I advised the father to disarm the son by placing
no opposition in his path. He should make but one
condition: the son must support himself and his
wife. Only a man capable of maintaining a wife
has the right to marry. I took the same attitude
explaining to the young man that he must make
himself independent of his father through his own
labor. He perceived plainly that the idea of maintaining
himself through his own labor did not appeal
to him. His greatest pleasure was the thought that
his father had to pay every time he went out with
a woman and that he was squandering his father’s
money.</p>

<p>At this time he confesses to me that he was about
to get married once before. It was in Berlin, shortly
after the homosexual relations with the young boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
He became acquainted with a girl who kept up intercourse
with him. This girl he wanted to marry and
his father went through the same trial with him.
He could not think of a greater revenge. Such subjects
show this trait again and again. It is not the
only case of the kind that I have met. The occurrence
is common and every experienced nerve
specialist is called in consultation over similar problems
several times in the course of a year. That
girl was the Frenchwoman who introduced him to all
forms of paraphiliac practices. The father, naturally
indignant, threatened to disinherit the son.
That was precisely what our patient was looking for.
He was afraid only of a soft-hearted father and he
managed always to rouse his anger as a sort of
protective screen between himself and his father.
The patient also felt that his father scorned him.
During the Berlin episode he clung to his Frenchwoman,
did not rest until his father met her, wanted
always to keep in her company and was afraid of
being alone with his father.</p>

<p>At this point the subject’s journey to Thuringen
with his father came up through numerous associations.
He accompanied on that journey not his
uncle, but his father, and he now recalls that during
the trip he frequently occupied one bed with his
father, and that it made him happy to think that
his father took him along instead of his mother.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that previously he remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
only the incident of slipping on a stone. That is
really a “Deckerinnerung.” The fall covers other
incidents: It stands for a fall into sin. I must
point out that the subject also links the return of
the trouble and its aggravation to an alleged fall.
The accident happened in a merry go round. He
fell unconscious but after a short time came fully
to himself and returned to the sport. The accident
could hardly have been a serious one. At any rate
the riddle of a fall belonged to the fancies with which
he had beclouded his journey to Thuringen. The
fiction established itself in his mind through his
occupying one bed with his father in the course of
that journey and his substituting the father for the
mother. His dreamy mind conceived the companion
as a woman, as the mother, and added the fiction
of a fall into sin, symbolically represented by the
trivial incident of an actual fall.</p>

<p>He now finds himself in a new homosexual danger.
I see him daily and he tries by various tricks to
induce me to give him a physical examination and
to show me his penis. He thinks he has again
gonorrhea, perhaps he has phthiriasis, I ought to
examine him, it would be foolish for him to go to another
physician for that. I explain these symptoms
and the man confesses that he has indulged also
openly in fancies in which I played a role. And now
he takes revenge by telling me about his bride and
dwelling on her tenderness for hours. He has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
other theme for talk. He must always have her
near him to feel quiet. She must not leave him for
a moment. Day and night he wants to hold her
hand ... thus he insures himself against homosexuality.</p>

<p>Finally I tell him I shall give up the psychoanalysis
if there is nothing else to come up. Then,
lo! his talk turns to other matters. He knows now
that his engagement is a defence measure against
his homosexuality and his filthy onanistic acts. But
he also sees that in his bride he has found a surrogate
for his mother. He surrounds her with
tenderness like a man who truly loves, and presently
his psychic intoxication turns into a deep and
true affection. He still has serious quarrels with
his bride. He still storms against his father and
against all authority. He is an anarchist at war
with all authority and assumes an obstinate attitude
towards everybody. But his father, apprised by me
of the true situation, keeps his temper and thus disarms
his son. Thus the engagement no longer
serves the object of worrying the parents. His
parents apparently let him have his own way, insisting
only that he should go to work. I doubt
his ability to get to work and express to him my
sympathy. He wants to show me that he can work.
At every opportunity I sympathize with his bride, a
quiet, brave little woman. He will surely abandon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
her. He cannot keep true. Not so! he declares.
He is going to show me that he can be true.</p>

<p>In a few weeks he finds a position and does his
work so carefully and diligently that his condition
is greatly improved. Then he marries and in every
sense of the word becomes a new man.</p>

<p>But there was a great deal more to do. His
paranoiac notions of grandeur, his feeling that he
could do anything which others may not, his
obstinacy and his rebellion against all authority
were gradually replaced by social tendencies. He
became modest and agreeable....</p>

<p>His complete recovery, he learned early, depended
on his keeping away from his parents. A short stay
in the old home roused all the old antagonisms and
he resolved to stay away so as to keep on friendly
terms with his parents.</p>

<p>At first all his affection was centered on his
bride and he did not wait for the marriage ceremony.... He
attained unbelievable accomplishments.... But
this did not continue for long and
soon he quieted down and had intercourse with his
wife at regular intervals.... Pregnancy and childbirth
made it necessary for him to keep away from
her for a time and he did so easily enough, without
being untrue to her.</p>

<p>I do not know how long this improvement will
last. He has kept his place for the past three years
with dignity and honor, and is today a quiet, brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
man who shudders when he thinks of his past. His
parents have reconciled themselves to his marriage
and the birth of two grandchildren has ratified in
their eyes the inevitable fact.</p>

<p>The character of satyriasis is richly illustrated
by this case. We see also why the Berlin air did
not agree with the subject. There he was in danger
of becoming overtly homosexual. In one Berlin
office where he worked there was a homosexual who
wanted to introduce him to his circle. He took a
sudden liking for his chief of whom he grew daily
more fond. The other men in the office made him
jealous and he resorted to quarreling, using vile talk.
Finally he broke with his chief as a defence against
the pent-up feelings within himself.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that during his relations
with the young boy he identified himself with his
father. He carried out the act of seduction which
he vainly expected to be acted out by his father.
His identification with the father went so far that
he felt himself aged, tired, played out and he thought
he might not live long. During his coprophiliac acts
he played the role of a suckling.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe what role he assumes
now while in love with his wife. A few remarks on
that point may not be out of place here:</p>

<p>During the first stage of his infatuation the subject
identified himself with his mother, while the
young woman stood for a boy, mostly himself. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
acted out the love scenes between mother and son
and he was surprised to find himself capable of such
motherly feelings. He emphasized his strong
femininity. He had, he thought, womanly hips, scant
beard growth, gynecomasty (full breasts). Organically
he was of that bisexual type which careful
examination of the neurotic never fails to disclose.
He was also attentive, gallant, dainty and mannerly.
Sometimes the bride was the mother and he
played the role of the child. He snuggled up in her
arms saying: “I should like to crawl in and lie like
a child in its mother’s bosom! That would be bliss.”
During coitus he preferred succubus and once there
occurred a strange incident. A fancy seemed to
dawn on him that he was having intercourse with
his mother. This was not a phantasy that I had
in any way suggested. I let the subject relate
everything that comes to his mind without influencing
him in one direction or another.</p>

<p>As he improved the identification with his mother
disappeared. He made up with his parents, exchanged
friendly letters with his father, and felt he
was making satisfactory progress. For the first
time in his life he was himself.</p>

<p>He became aware of his own personality. Now
he loved his wife as a husband, and felt that he was
a father who had a mother of his own.</p>

<p>That may seem self-evident and an irrelevant remark.
But the whole task which I aimed to achieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
was to break up his identification with his parents,
destroy his projection upon the old home. Previously
the leading motive in all his conduct was the
thought: <i>what will my parents say?</i> The knowledge
that his father would be troubled made him happy.
He wanted to punish the man whom he held responsible
for his sufferings on account of his lack of proper
responsiveness and to keep the father always in
trouble. Now he abandoned his infantilism. He
was a child no longer, he was a man. Overcoming
all disguises and masks he came to himself.</p>

<p>His homosexuality persisted as formerly. But
he saw this clearly before his eyes and recognized it
openly in his relations with his superiors, his friends
and his psychoanalytic adviser. He could meet the
issue and overcome it. Perhaps he shifted a part of
it over to his son. One thing is certain: he is through
with the homosexual longing and so completely that
it no longer troubles him. He is alert and active.
Such result would not be attained without the art of
analysis and without the physician’s educational
skill. This man, in the absence of analysis, would
have probably ended his misery in suicide.</p>

<p>I must also point out that his genuine affection
for his wife developed out of an impulsive infatuation.
He met the woman, spoke to her, and fell in
love with her at once. Yet the marriage is happier
as time passes. Trifling storms do occur—where
do they not—but they blow lightly over and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
home life is one of quiet happiness. The dream
about his great historic mission is gone. He who
had once the ambition to become a Napoleon or a
Herostratos, a Satan or a Don Juan, a bomb-thrower,
is now a reliable, efficient and satisfied bookkeeper;
he now sits at his desk in the office dutifully
adding long columns of figures, brings home little
presents for his wife and children, and if his old
folks send him a sum of money he is pleasantly surprised
and puts it in the bank for his little daughter.
This case illustrates also the relations of homosexuality
to the family and to the problem of incest.
More about that later....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nymphomania shows the same homosexual basis
as satyriasis. In the study of Sexual Frigidity in
Women<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> we shall have occasion to point out types
of women who are undoubtedly nymphomaniac in
character, Messalinas. These women are usually
anesthetic, a condition in itself of considerable
significance and one which is often seen also in ordinary
prostitutes. They have a hunger for man
similar to Don Juan’s longing for woman. It is
characteristic of them, too, that they never find
satisfaction. These persons in perpetual quest,
Ahasuerus, the Flying Dutchman, Faust and Don
Juan, who are condemned to wander and search and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
who never find rest, portray the libido which does
not find its proper sexual goal.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>There are also among women endless seekers continually
dreaming of man,—some man who shall completely
and lastingly gratify them. The conditions
are even more complex in women than in men. For
the present I want to report briefly one case, pointing
out merely what may serve as an illustration of
our present theme. We shall take up the whole subject
more fully in connection with our discussion of
dyspareunia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A woman, strikingly beautiful,—we shall call her
Adele—comes to me with a most unusual complaint.
She is married to an excellent man with whom she
had fallen in love and she still loves him. She has
no inclination whatever to remain true to him. She
lacks completely any resistance to temptation. She
is easily the victim of any man who comes near her.
She is a woman who does not know how to say “no.”
Her husband who has no inkling of her doings worships
her. Sometimes she is conscience stricken, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
now, and wishes to find something that would quiet
her so that she would not have to think from morning
till night only of sexual matters. But, what I
shall find unbelievable, she adds, is that she remains
cold during a man’s embrace and must always follow
it up with onanism. Only cunnilingus produces an
adequate orgasm in her. She thinks that if a man
satisfied her regularly in that way perhaps she could
remain true to him.</p>

<p>From her life history I quote the following data.
Already as a child Adele had gathered certain experiences
on the subject of sex. She was about
eight years of age when her brother began to carry
out coitus with her. She was very sensual even at
that time and claims that she experienced great
pleasure in the act. The brother was two years
older. All the children in the apartment building
where they lived were introduced early to sexual
acts. Often there took place regular orgies. She
was loaned by her brother to other boys when he
received their sisters in exchange. She remembers
having been used once by four boys in succession.
These doings went on for over a year. Then another
girl’s mother discovered what was going on and
matters came very near being aired in court. There
were scenes and investigations but all the children
lied themselves out of it.</p>

<p>From that time on she masturbated and to this
day she cannot give up the habit. Even as a “flap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>per”
she had no other thought than to attract men.
She was very coquettish and easy going, improved
for a time, becoming very devout as well as retired
in her disposition and even thought of joining a
nunnery and taking the vows of chastity.</p>

<p>But this pious attitude did not last long. Soon
she flirted again and turned to all kinds of erotic
books, the reading of which so excited her that she
masturbated several times during the night. At 17
years of age, a pupil of her father’s who was teacher
of piano at the musical high school, took advantage
of her. She was alone with the young man for a few
minutes. He kissed her and she accepted this without
resistance. Then he dragged her on top of
himself—there was no couch in that study room—and
she lost her virginity. She did not know how it
happened. It was over in a few minutes. She kept
away from the young man after that, although he
pursued her, and for a few weeks lived in terror,
afraid that she might be pregnant. But fortunately
that was not the case. She soon noticed that all
men were interested in her. Young and old pursued
her. The mother to whom, with tears in her eyes,
she related the incident with the young man and
who kept it from the father (fearing that he would
murder the boy) kept careful watch over her, never
left her alone, always saying to her: “Child, you
must marry soon! Your blood is too hot.”</p>

<p>At 19 years of age she found her man, with whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
she fell in love so desperately that she became the
laughing stock of the town. During the very first
days of courtship she fell into his arms and offered
no resistance when he tried to possess her completely.
He was so excited that he failed to observe
that she was not a virgin. She enjoyed the experience
but little, although she was tremendously
excited at the time.</p>

<p>From the very beginning she was untrue to him.
She carried on with a friend of his, going even to
that man’s house. She was unhappy and wanted to
do away with herself. But she soon got over that
and again began flirting.</p>

<p>After the marriage ceremony—three days later—she
recalled having heard that Dr. X., an attractive
young single man, was a great Don Juan. She
decided to look him up at once and seduce him. She
complained to him of a red spot upon her privates,
claiming it troubled her. Was that not a sign of
some illness? In short, she attained her purpose,
was his sweetheart for a time, and learned then of
cunnilingus for the first time. That she regarded as
the highest achievement in the art of love. Another
man required of her the anal form of copulation.
All such things amused her, although she never experienced
the orgasm as satisfactorily as during
masturbation.</p>

<p>Before long she felt painful remorse. She had
the best of men for a husband. She tortured herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with the most severe reproaches, daily saying to
herself: “This must be the last time; I must not
do it again.” But the very next day she felt impelled
again to go into the street or to telephone
to one of the many men who were at her disposal.
It is interesting to note that on her list of lovers
there were physicians, lawyers, army officers, clerks,
nobles and commoners. She never took payment and
never accepted presents. That would put her in a
class with the prostitutes. She also tried coachmen
and chauffeurs, but her disgust afterwards was so
great that she gave this up, although she always
felt the temptation.</p>

<p>She acquired a gonorrheal infection and this compelled
her to claim “female trouble” as an excuse to
keep her husband away from her for a time. She
was so provoked with the man who had infected her
that she wanted to revenge herself on all men and
in her anger thought of transferring the infection
to every man in her circle. She did not carry out
this plan because the gynecologist who treated her
forbade all sexual congress. Nevertheless twice she
could not control herself and she infected two
men....</p>

<p>She wanted me to hypnotize her. There was no
other thought in her mind than men and again men!
Her mind revolved continually around sexual scenes;
she has even thought of going for a time to a house
of prostitution, and, like Agrippina, allow any num<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>ber
of men to use her until she shall have had enough.
Perhaps then she would quiet down! If she meets
a stranger that night she dreams of intercourse with
him!</p>

<p>I ask her about the dreams; whether they lay stress
on some special form of intercourse or portray
merely the normal act.</p>

<p>Hesitatingly she answers: “Always the normal.
Only I am regularly on top.... Why is that? I
have often thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Did you have such a dream last night?”</p>

<p>“Let me see. Certainly; a foolish dream,
though....”</p>

<p>“Please, let me hear it.”</p>

<p>“I am in bed with my brother-in-law. A man of
whom I would not even dream.”</p>

<p>“But you did dream of him.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it. I have never given him
one minute’s thought.”</p>

<p>“And never anything happened between you?”</p>

<p>“No ... with him, never. Although he is attentive
to me and I know he likes me. I love my sister
too dearly to treat her that way, although my sister
is not faithful either, and things like that don’t matter
with her. It seems to be in the family. Still, I
would rather have nothing to do with my brother-in-law.
The dream is nonsense, I have forgotten the
most of it. It was much longer.”</p>

<p>Observing that she tries to avoid the dream I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
insist that she should try and recall it as nearly as
possible. “Well, then,” she continues her narrative,
“the dream was as follows:</p>

<p>”<i>I am in bed with my brother-in-law. It seems I
am the man and he the woman. He has no mustache
and lies under me. Suddenly he changes and it is my
sister and I kiss her passionately. ‘You see,’ she says
to me, ‘you should have done this long ago and you
would be well.’</i>”</p>

<p>I inquire about her relations to the sister and
learn that she has not been in touch with her for the
past few months and that during this time she has
grown more nervous and her craving for men also
grew worse than ever. “When I am with my sister I
seem to forget men more easily. She is a very
spiritual person and extremely charming. If you
should ever meet her you would fall in love with
her.”</p>

<p>When one hears such talk, and one hears it rather
often, the diagnosis is easy: the narrator is in love
with that person and therefore thinks it natural that
everybody should fall in love with the person in
question.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Further inquiries disclose that she was preoccupied
with but one thought: her sister. She always
looks upon her sister as the best dressed, most
spirited and most charming person she had ever
known.</p>

<p>Why was the woman no longer on friendly terms
with her sister?</p>

<p>Because, she claims, her sister is egotistical and
cares nothing for her. She was lying ill for a few
weeks and her sister let her lie there and took no
more notice of her than if she were a dog; she wanted
her sister’s company when she went out, she could
not do her shopping alone but she could not get her
sister to go along. So she had to go around with a
woman friend who was a disgusting and vulgar person.
She ought to be ashamed to show herself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
such company; if she were in her husband’s place,
she would not tolerate it.... After all, it would
not be so very sinful if she did become intimate with
her brother-in-law; her sister was not true to him
and kept up relations with an army lieutenant but
the poor fool does not see it and thinks the army
officer is his best friend....</p>

<p>She keeps up an incessant flow of talk. She wakes
up thinking of her sister, she thinks of her all day
and she dreams of her every night. I have studied
her dreams over a period of weeks. There is not a
dream in which her sister fails to figure and none
but portrays her erotic attitude towards the sister.</p>

<p>In the course of the analysis her childhood experiences
come to light and she recalls that for a long
time she slept in one bed with her sister and they
performed cunnilingus on one another. That was
so long ago, she had forgotten all about it. That
experience discloses her true nature. She is continually
looking for woman; specifically she is looking
for one woman, her sister. She wants to forget
her, the traumatic experience with her she wants to
drive out of memory, by covering it with new experiences.</p>

<p>We see that her latent homosexuality drives her
into the arms of every man she meets. We also note
the role of family relations in homosexuality, a subject
which we shall take up specifically later and
illustrate with proper data.</p>

<p>We have spoken thus far of the active Don Juan
and of Messalina types and we have attempted to
prove that homosexuality is responsible. Along the
extreme types we find endless varieties of transitional
types. Nature nowhere confounds us through the
richness of her varieties and combinations so much
as in the manifestations of human sexuality.</p>

<p>The would-be Don Juan and would-be Messalina
are most interesting types. They behave precisely
like the true type. They manifest the same uncontrollable
and restless craving. But somewhere in
their development the capacity to carry out heterosexual
adventures fails them. I am not now speaking
of the man who plays Don Juan in his mind’s
fancy or of the Messalina who does not truly possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the courage to try to live up to her instinctive cravings.
There are numberless such cases and a bit
of the type lurks in the breast of every person, a
fact we recognize as the polygamic tendency.</p>

<p>The type which I wish to describe approaches the
ascetic. It is plain that the ascetic ideal would
not arise if a strong homosexual tendency did not
depreciate heterosexuality. For every action is the
product of instinct and repression. An overpowerful
instinct may overcome even the strongest inhibitions.
But if a portion of the individual’s sexual energy is
anchored homosexually the aggressive sexual acts
are endowed only with a portion of the energy they
require. If the energy is shunted off its proper track
entirely we have the ascetic person; and if the
energy is but partially side-tracked and is insufficient
for the accomplishment of the sexual aim, we
have the would-be Don Juan type.</p>

<p>There are any number of men who daily dream
only of their possible conquests, begin adventures,
and carry them along for a time only to drop the
affairs suddenly ... because they “get cold feet.”
They envy men who are able to pursue their adventures
to the end, men fortunate enough actually to
make conquests and they bewail the fate which brings
them so close to the most tempting fruit only to
prove elusive just when the fruit seems ready to fall
into their lap,—and to be gone forever. Better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
all generalizations may serve the account of an
actual case, like the following:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Xaver Z., would like to be a “lively fellow,”
like most of his companions. He claims that his
shyness spoils his success. He is 29 years old and
has never yet had a “real” affair. When he wakes
up in the morning he thinks: “Will you have luck today
to talk up to a girl and get her?” The whole
day he thinks of this so that he is continually distracted
and unable to work. He is also dissatisfied
with his business accomplishments. Others work so
easily and accomplish everything without friction,
he is slow and not energetic enough. He thinks that
somehow he lacks initiative. He is always tired and
depressed, and he has already been in sanitaria several
times vainly trying to get well. He can hardly
wait for evening to arrive so he may go into the
street in search of adventure. He speaks to a number
of girls but nothing comes of it. He has also
tried a “personal” in the newspaper and corresponds
with several women. But they are only platonic relations.
He either lacks the courage to become
more intimate with the women or finds himself
repulsed when making a suggestion of the kind. He
thinks he is unlike other men and it discourages him.
He always feels lonely and Sundays are a torture to
him. He tries to meet poor people and pays them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
occasionally to partake of an evening meal with
them so as not to feel quite so lonely.</p>

<p>He is a travelling salesman. He fears that he is
not an efficient salesman. He lacks the power of
influencing his prospective customers, he seems unable
to talk as convincingly to them as other men
in his calling. He acts indifferent and if he sees that
the customer does not intend to buy he goes right
off. He is employed by an older brother. He is
lucky. Another employer would have dismissed him
long ago. While his brother does not reproach him
in words he can read it in the brother’s eyes.</p>

<p>Regarding his sexual life he is able to state that
sexual matters began early to interest him. He
does not remember the beginning of it. He does
remember that he masturbated at 10 years of age
and he continued the practice till he was 20 years
old. Then he heard about the evil consequences and
gradually gave it up. But even after that he masturbated
every two months or so and always felt
very worried after doing it.</p>

<p>He began going to women at twenty years of age.
Since that time he has intercourse about once every
two weeks with prostitutes, or occasionally with
some girl whom he picks up on the street and who
usually expects pay; he is strongly potent. He
has no particular pleasure with prostitutes. He
goes to them out of a sense of duty because all his
colleagues have intercourse with women and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
wants to be like them. It is a hygienic measure
rather than an inner compulsion with him. But he
always fancies that, under the right conditions,
when the girl gives herself out of love, it must be
different. He felt so dissatisfied because he was
never lucky enough to have a real sweetheart. For
the girls he picked up on the street were really nothing
more than ordinary prostitutes since they, too,
expect some present if not regular pay.</p>

<p>He was distinctly unlucky. Other young men
were always lucky but he, quite the contrary. There
must be something about him that makes persons
keep away when they get to know him more intimately.</p>

<p>If these complaints are looked upon as true facts
one would really think that the young man was unlucky.
But as a matter of fact he himself lays the
foundation for his lack of luck, he alone spreads the
bed in which he is to lie. He is a Don Juan who
carries on flawlessly the first part of his adventures;
it is only when he tries to bring the adventures to a
head that his luck fails him and then the expected
conquest turns into a deception.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It appears that he has actually brought many of
his adventures to a crisis only to withdraw at the
supreme moment on the score of some triviality or
other. These occurrences are all alike except that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the alleged motives for breaking up the adventure
differ in every case. Perhaps it will be best to mention
his last adventure as an example, for it is
particularly typical:</p>

<p>It was Sunday. Xaver felt again very lonely and
neglected and went out looking for a girl. An old
friend whom he was to meet at a certain place he
neglected to look up. Today he must succeed. He
is tired of loneliness and neglect. Today he will
get a girl. He makes a few attempts but in each
case he finds the girl expects pay and that does not
suit him. Finally he sees passing by a fine, sinewy,
supple figure. He hurries after it—she is an
elegant, attractive woman. He speaks up, telling
her in one breath that she must not be angry, his
intentions are “entirely honorable.” He merely feels
lonely and would like to spend the evening in pleasant
company. The woman is not prudish, she permits
him to accompany her and confesses that she, too, is
lonely and feels terribly depressed. He now worries
because he promised her “an honorable acquaintance”
and during the walk tries to make up his mind
whether he ought not to change his tactics. It
begins to rain. They enter a Café where they listen
to some music; then they go to a restaurant for dinner.
He shows himself very gallant, pays all expenses
and conducts her home. The woman tells him
she has a telephone, as she conducts a little business
and suggests that he may call her up. They agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
to meet the following Sunday and spend their time
together. During the week he plans a line of attack
and decides to put an end to his shyness and come
with her to the real object.... He calls her up,
they decide to go to the Opera together and then
to a late supper. On Sunday forenoon he purchases
the tickets and intends to put them at her disposal.
Suddenly the thought strikes him, he ought to give
up the relationship. He sends the spare ticket to a
friend and telephones the woman that some of his
relatives having arrived unexpectedly he cannot go
to the Opera. Afterwards he is unhappy over it, etc.</p>

<p>The friend was otherwise engaged, he remained
alone, the ticket was wasted. He worried considerably
over the matter and returned home feeling sad.
When I pointed out to him next day that he really
fled from the girl, he shook his head and said his
sister was really responsible because “I told her
everything and asked her what I should do. Sister
said: ‘she is pulling your leg, it will cost you money
and nothing will come of it.’”</p>

<p>“Do you tell your sister these things?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. We speak very frankly about all
sexual matters. Sister has started the custom and
I find it natural. Why should I not advise with
sister?”</p>

<p>I explain to him that he expected her to turn him
against the adventure, that he was really afraid of
the relationship and its possible consequences. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
show that the friend was more to him than the
woman and that the sending of the ticket to him
meant: <i>my friend is more important to me than a
woman!</i></p>

<p>I have occasion to prove again and again that he
paves the way for his failures very adroitly and
sometimes tactlessly because while acting the role of
a “lively” man he wants at the same time to preserve
his inner attitude. The initial stage of conquest
satisfies him and thereafter he voluntarily renounces
to its consummation.</p>

<p>That he vehemently denies,—he knows absolutely
nothing about any homosexual leaning! He declares
he would be right if he could only have the right
kind of a love affair. He is continually looking for
it. It was really unbelievable to hear how many adventures
he was able to start in the course of a
week. He was a handsome interesting man and
found no trouble conquering women’s hearts. But
he always managed affairs so as to break them up
before they went too far. At the last moment he
always thought of something or other which prevented
consummation of the adventure.</p>

<p>This was shown typically one New Year’s day.
A woman from a distance, with whom he was in
correspondence—they had also exchanged their
photographs—invited herself for that evening. He
was to meet her at the train and they were to celebrate
the New Year’s together. He went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
station but missed her because he “waited at the
wrong place.” Next day he succeeded in tracing her.
Naturally she was angry by that time; then, thinking
to make up with her he proposed on the spot to
take the woman to a hotel with him. Naturally she
resented the insult and made him scurry out of her
presence. He had provoked this precipitate dismissal
by his sudden proposal. He managed things
so that every promising victory turned into a defeat
in the end.</p>

<p>He was late at his appointments or showed himself
overanxious and even coarse at the last moment,
when the situation was most delicate, or made some
uncalled-for remark. Thus, to one girl who was
already on the way to a hotel with him he said:
“Ah, all women are alike, they all run after men
and when they catch one they are happy!” She
looked at him with lifted brows: “Is that what you
think of a girl who goes with you? Then I want to
have nothing to do with you ...” and turning
around she walked off.</p>

<p>That does not prevent him from running again
after girls; he even accosts married women on the
street but he always complains about his poor luck.
At the same time his sexual desire is not excessive.
His physical requirements never cause him any uneasiness.
It is a psychic urge that drives him to
seek women. At the same time he longs for friends
but then, such friends as he seeks are also not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
found. Only the last friend was such a one because
“he understood him.” They went to brothels together.
That was the first time he experienced a
really strong orgasm. We know this custom on the
part of men to be a convenient mask for homosexuality.</p>

<p>The motives of his conduct are revealed in a dream
which throws considerable light on the significance
of homosexuality.</p>

<p>We have recognized for some time that this is a
case of latent homosexuality, repressed on the negative
principle of aversion.</p>

<p>Xaver speaks incessantly of women, thinks of
them all day long, so as to avoid thinking of men.
He tries to lean on women, but never becomes intimate
with them because the negative force that
drives him is not powerful enough. The better
woman is for him a “noli me tangere,” he suffers from
an inhibition which keeps him from every woman who
is not paid. The prostitute is not considered a
woman and, besides, her charm is increased by the
fact that she has intercourse with other men.
Through her it is therefore possible to give an outlet
to a portion of the homosexual tendency.</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to his dream.
<i>Naecke</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> justly remarks that the dream is the best
reagent for homosexuality. Unfortunately he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
not familiar at the time with the revelations of dream
analysis and he paid attention only to the manifest
content. How much richer in meaning the dream
shows itself when we learn to read it and to interpret
its hidden symbolism.</p>

<p>The Dream:</p>

<p><i>I am pursued by men and fear they are about to
do something to me. One man in particular, brandishing
a big sword, is very hotly on my trail and
already he touches me from behind with the tip edge
of his sword, a curved thing like the Yatagan used
by Turks. I run to the cemetery to mother’s grave.
I find there my cousin (female) who is also afraid of
the robbers. First we try to hide, then we look
around carefully and see that the coast is clear. We
leave the cemetery together in a carriage and we
drive upon an endless dark road. I snuggle up to
her, as if for protection against the robbers and I
am ashamed of my unmanly attitude.</i></p>

<p>Of course it is not proper to conclude that a
dreamer is homosexual merely because the dream carries
a homosexual meaning. For, as I have shown in
my <i>Language of Dreams</i>, every dream is bisexual,
consequently homosexual traits may be found in
every dream. The dream only portrays once more
man’s bisexual nature and even the dreams of homosexuals
are, without exception, bisexual. We see
through them merely the degree of the repressed
homosexuality and the dreams enable us to recog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>nize
more easily the motives which impell the subjects
to adopt a monosexual path....<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This dream begins with a typical portrayal of a
homosexual pursuit. The subject is really pursued
by his homosexual thoughts. The great curved
sword is a well-known phallic symbol. That the
sword touches him from behind is something easily
interpreted. Equally obvious is the reason why the
sword appears curved when we learn that his brother
has a hypospadia and a phallus of that shape so
that medical advice was even sought on the matter.
The pursuer had a big heavy beard exactly like his
brother and the same figure. Thus we see that the
brother, who stands out of the mass of pursuing
males, in a certain measure typifies the homosexual
pursuit.</p>

<p>He flies to his mother’s grave in the cemetery.
His mother shall save him from homosexuality. She,
the representative of femininity, is the one to whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
he flies, when pursued by men. The cousin is the wife
of another brother. She represents the typical incest
compromise. Many neurotics who are emotionally
fixed upon their family, finally marry a cousin. The
cousin, whom he finds at the grave, is his savior and
he starts with her upon the dark path of life, a half
man....</p>

<p>He tells that he was to marry the woman but she
became instead his brother’s wife because he kept
hesitating and would not make up his mind. But
he had the fancy that he could be her sweetheart. He
is specially fond of his brothers’ wives and his
sisters.... He has numberless phantasies revolving
around incestuous deeds. His two sisters also figure
in these day dreams.... He grew accustomed to
talk over sexual matter with his sister not without
reason. He tells her all his adventures with preconceived
watchfulness. Thus he told her also of
the late acquaintance, as mentioned above, and was
advised, as she had previously advised him in a number
of similar instances, to keep away. Unconsciously
he was awaiting from her the reply: <i>Why go
out of your way? Why seek in other women what
you can find in me?</i> ...</p>

<p>We understand now the inhibition which stands
between him and women of “the better class.”
The latter stand for the sister and the mother. The
incest taboo is what stands in his way. He looks for
a true adventure but cannot find it. He looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
for his sister and he looks for the man. His brothers’
wives are the objects of his jealousy and his yearning
at the same time. With his questions and problems he
goes to his sisters-in-law, never to his brothers. His
conscience is uneasy with regard to his brothers.
In their presence he is always timid and ill at ease.
He is in love with his older brother though he does
not acknowledge the fact to himself. His brother’s
strength and energy rouse his admiration. Occasionally
his brother sang. The voice lingers in his
ears so sweetly that he declares his brother to be
the best singer in the world. He feels that his
brother neglects him. The brother does not seem to
notice how ill he is or how much he suffers. Once
he was quite a jolly fellow but now (since giving up
masturbation) he is mostly depressed. But the
brother takes no notice of it and never asks him how
he feels or how it goes with his health. If he only
could quit his brother’s business! He belittles himself
in order to cling to the brother more lovingly.
He could not endure being away from his brother.
He does poorly during his business trips because it
is against his wish to travel at all and because he is
jealous of his brother’s large business.</p>

<p>His attitude towards the second brother, who was
his playmate in childhood, is even more tense. He
never visits that brother and when he cannot avoid
meeting him has but little to say. He shows that
peculiar uneasiness towards the brother which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
persons manifest when they try to cover a certain
erotic attitude.</p>

<p>The following characteristic dream may be instructive
at this point:</p>

<p><i>I am in my brother’s store ... He puts before me
an assortment of underwear to mark up. I refuse
to do it and step out of the store saying: “Brother
can kiss me....”</i></p>

<p>His brother advised him to get married. This is
the incentive to the dream language “underwear to
be marked.” But he loves only his brother. The
remark, “<i>er kann mich gern haben</i>,” (equivalent to
the colloquialism, “he can kiss me,” and its more
vulgar variants) plainly embodies a reference to a
sexual act.</p>

<p>Incidentally anal irritation is one of his strongest
paraphilias. He suffers more or less continually of
“anal itching,” which is at times so unbearable that
he cannot sleep. He consulted for this complaint
a physician who found no local trouble and who declared
that it was merely a “nervous” itching.</p>

<p>The fact is this subject is now on the point of becoming
a homosexual. Some precipitating occasion
and his homosexuality is bound to become manifest.
His last friend is dearer to him than all the
girls.... This is shown clearly by the fact that he
sent him the ticket which he had bought for his lady
friend. A portion of the hidden impulse had broken
forth on that occasion. Usually he covers his homo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>sexual
leanings very cleverly. His friends and colleagues
at the office think he is a lucky Don Juan and
have no idea that he never enjoys the ultimate advantage
of the role he plays. They see him always
in the company of girls, always going around with
pretty women; he runs after them on the street, he
goes to public places with them; at the office he
speaks of nothing else but his conquests and new
adventures.</p>

<p>But not to his brothers. He never mentions any
sexual matters especially in the presence of his
younger brother, the one who was his playmate in
childhood.</p>

<p>The analysis did not last long. But during the
very first few weeks there came to light experiences
with this brother which explained the subject’s
reticence.</p>

<p>Considering the remarkable fact that Xaver was
animated by the desire to be a regular Don Juan we
have something with which to contrast the extent of
his moral qualms. For a long time he was very
pious and then all of a sudden he turned into a free
thinker. Analysis discloses that his religious piety
still persists undiminished. Don Juan stands to
his mind only for the unreachable ideal of a free
man, a man undisturbed in his actions by any inhibitory
feelings. But he invariably hears an inner
voice calling to him, at the last, supreme moment
of action: <i>Don’t! It is sinful.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>It is the voice of his mother, who never failed to
dwell on moral themes, who warned him against the
dangers of the big City, his mother whom he so
loved and honored. How often his dreams lead him
to the cemetery where his mother lies buried, as if
to conjure up before his eyes the dear image and to
remind him to avoid all evil and to follow in the
Lord’s righteous path!</p>

<p>This case illustrates the significant role of family
environment in the genesis of that homosexuality
which <i>Hirschfeld</i> calls genuine. We find a fixation
upon the sisters, also a fixation upon the mother,
and the passionate love for the brothers, particularly
for the older one, with whose wife he sees himself
driving off in a dream. That cousin really
stands for his brother. Through her union with his
brother she had acquired a new attraction for him.
Before her marriage he was rather indifferent towards
her. The homosexual experiences with his
younger brother date back to his 16th year.</p>

<p>His craving for love affairs, the impulsion to
women, was but a flight away from the pursuit of
man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next patient shows an entirely different constellation.
Whereas Xaver was clever enough to
free himself from the terrible women through his
peculiar tactlessness, the following subject reassured
himself by conjuring up an ailment which be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>came
very troublesome, it is true, but which proved
an effective means of defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Christoph—we shall designate the subject by
that name—is a victim of chronic stomach trouble
which, according to the opinion of various physicians,
is of a nervous origin. He has attacks of
sharp gastric pains, and loss of appetite so that he
has grown very thin and looks like an advanced
victim of consumption. (Lungs and all other organs
are in excellent condition.) He cannot digest
any meat, any attempt to do so produces intense
pain, and if he swallows so much as a mouthful he is
likely to vomit. He denies that he ever masturbated,
and claims that his sexual life is entirely normal.
Formerly he was in the habit of going around with
girls, but it gave him no pleasure, probably because
prostitutes are disgusting to him, and with other
girls he did not care to become too intimate for
ethical reasons. He would like to be hypnotized so
that he should be cured of his aversion to food. I
decline hypnosis and advise, instead, a complete
analysis. Only in that way may he learn the way
to a complete cure. He insists he has not withheld
anything in his talk with me. He has told me
everything and wants hypnosis by all means but
this I refuse.</p>

<p>He says he will think it over. My questions took
him by surprise. He was unprepared. He is one
of those men who have to think matters over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
don’t make up their mind in a hurry. One of his
rules through which he learned to protect himself
against life’s sudden perplexities is: “Don’t lose
your head. Think it over.”</p>

<p>He calls a few times continually talking about his
pains. One day he states that he has about made
up his mind to quit. But next day he returns and
brings me a lengthy written document: “You have
asked me repeatedly about my dreams. I have written
down my last night’s dreams. I always dream
a lot and my dreams are always lively and about like
those of last night. I have also brought along my
true confessions to let you know what I really am.
You will see from the confession of my life history
what brought about my illness. I see I cannot get
along any more trying to keep it all to myself. Let
the truth come out.”</p>

<p>I am now giving this life history as it was presented
to me in writing, following it up with the
dream report.</p>


<p><i>The Story of My Illness and My Biography</i></p>

<p>I lived in the parental home up to my 4th year
and then I was taken in charge by my mother’s
people. My father’s business compelled him to be
away from home for months, sometimes for a whole
year at a stretch. My grandparents brought me up
with much tenderness, and as they were very re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>ligious,
my education was also based on piety. They
lived in a very prettily situated village, an old,
lovely resort place. The river flowing nearby was
naturally the meeting place for us children. On
account of the danger of drowning I was an object
of great concern to my grandparents, so that they
tried to keep me close to them as much as possible.
I went with them to church daily, visited with them,
usually at the homes of elderly people where the conversation
was almost exclusively about religious
matters, and on every occasion it was drilled into
me under the most terrible threats and admonitions
to pray and be good.</p>

<p>I heard numerous stories of deeds and miracles
attributed to the Holy Mother and I was shown
the places where some of these took place in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Then I returned to mother. Soon afterwards I
went to school. Sister taught me the primer and
soon I was able to go through my favorite book,
an old large copy of the Bible, whereas formerly I
depended on questioning others.</p>

<p>Frequently I gave up all games preferring to sit
in a corner poring over my Bible. It is customary
in the country to undergo a public examination in
the church every half year. My sister two and one
half years older than I prepared herself for that
event for some time because she did not learn easily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
I followed her study carefully and was able to recite
everything as well as she.</p>

<p>The examination came up at the church and no
one could answer a certain question. But I knew
the answer, because it was part of sister’s lesson,
made signs, the vicar asked me and I surprised everybody
by giving the correct answer. It was the
prayer, “Our Father.” My folks admired me for
it, gave me presents and said: “Boy, you will grow
up to be a fine man.” This praise touched me very
deeply.</p>

<p>I was about seven and a half when a girl of twelve
induced me to join her in forbidden games, we played
with each other’s genitals, etc. This occurred very
often. I liked it very much and the experience became
deeply imprinted on my mind. Then I felt a
strong desire to repeat the same games with other
girls. My mother’s sister visited us about a year
later and while she caressed me she roused in me a
new feeling and I could hardly refrain myself from
asking her to play with me the games that the first
girl had taught me.</p>

<p>Beginning with the third year of school we had
a new teacher. He took notice of me early because
I was a good scholar and soon I became one of his
favorite pupils. This teacher had the horrible
habit of calling me to his desk where he held me by
the member until it became stiff, while talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
to me. I wondered a great deal what it meant; but
I did not dare mention it to any one.</p>

<p>At the end of that school year we removed to
Vienna permanently. I was tremendously homesick
for the old place; the coolness and indifference
of the new surroundings at Vienna affected me and
secretly I resolved that I would rather starve than
stay there. I was threatened that I would not be
allowed to visit the old home if I did not make
progress and I would be sent to a sanitarium; the
last threat in particular scared me especially as I
was shown some (false) papers to indicate that the
first steps had already been taken to have me interned.
That and the perpetual anxiety at school
where we had a queer teacher who mistreated horribly
the pupils (and I did not know a word of
German at the time), had a serious effect upon me;
my physical condition was impaired, I grew thin and
lived in a sort of dream state. During my solitude
I often sought relief in tears.</p>

<p>I lived through the period. In two years, here
too, I reached one of the first places as a scholar.
I had a colleague at school, whose sixteen-year-old
brother was compelled to stay at home for a year
on account of illness and we played with him. The
two initiated me into all sorts of nasty practices.
The brothers slept together in one bed, underneath
their parents, and had frequent opportunity to see
their parents lying together. They always told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
about it and showed me their mother’s stained shirt.
This impressed me very much and I also began to
watch my parents. Till my twelfth year I slept in
one bed with my sister. Then I slept near mother
in bed, as father was mostly away.</p>

<p>My fancies grew to such unhealthy dimensions,
that I began to think my uncle, mother’s brother,
who was living with us at the time, was guilty of
criminal intimacy with her. Slowly my suspicions
were allayed, as I could observe nothing out of the
ordinary, despite watchfulness.</p>

<p>Around thirteen a school boy taught me to
masturbate. I did not do it often because I feared
it was sinful and it kept me in continuous anxiety.
Then a book fell into my hands describing the terrible
consequences of the habit. That scared me
off completely, and as a positive protection, when I
was about fourteen and a half I swore over grandfather’s
grave that I would have nothing to do with
sexual matters till my twentieth year. I suffered a
great deal in consequence on account of my pent-up
desires. But I was fairly faithful to my oath.</p>

<p>At fourteen I joined a higher institution. My
preparation was far below that of my colleagues
and one of the teachers warned me that I might not
be able to keep up with the course at that institution.
That worried me a great deal. It affected me considerably
to think that in this way I might be
hampered in the free choice of a vocation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>At the first examination it turned out that only
I and one other student passed successfully and I
looked upon that as a divine favor, the more so because
my very affectionate grandmother prayed for
me continually.</p>

<p>I was permitted to take the course on condition
that I should earn for myself remission of the school
fees, which amounted to a considerable sum. Only
the best scholars received free tuition. I plunged
zealously into the subjects on which my preliminary
preparation was weak.</p>

<p>My thrifty zeal was not flawless. I was always
confident that God was with me and I thought that
I owed to his intervention, rather than to my constant
application the position of a scholar of the
first rank which I had attained in two years’ time.</p>

<p>During that period I came again into contact with
that girl who was the first to initiate me into sexual
matters. Her presence continually disturbed me.</p>

<p>When I was about seventeen and a half I had
some innocent love affairs with some other girls, but
although opportunities for coitus were frequent, I
never took advantage of them. Reason: my fear
of immoral deeds.</p>

<p>I slept with my sister and a girl cousin in one
room. I concentrated my attention upon the girl
cousin. The frequent allurements kept me in a
continuous state of agitation the more so because
I could see that the cousin, too, had to struggle hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
to suppress her inclinations and desires. I withstood
all temptation and remained innocent.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the school years I came into
closer contact with a girl who had already previously
attracted my attention. We became deeply interested
in one another, but we could meet only occasionally
and that under very strict conditions.
We had to part in the end; as I really loved the girl
it made me suffer a great deal. During the occasions
when we did steal away to our secret trysting
place I felt a peculiar excitation which settled on
my stomach; if I ate it caused me nausea.</p>

<p>After completing my course of study I entered the
employ of a local business house. I became acquainted
with another girl, and strange enough, we
two also had to overcome considerable difficulties
when we tried to meet. After about a year we
could meet freely and shortly after there were no
more difficulties in our way. But I lost interest in
her by that time, and decided that I would have
nothing to do with any such foolish love affairs.</p>

<p>Whereas formerly I was kept back from any
thought of coitus with a decent girl because I considered
it an unworthy and dishonorable act, now
whenever I was about to meet a girl I was seized
with a gastric discomfort and even vomiting. Once
in the girl’s company that would disappear.</p>

<p>I gave up all affairs of heart, but my condition
became gradually worse. I vomited several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
daily, I could not even tolerate a mouthful of bread
on my stomach, even clear soup was hard for me to
take. Every time I swallowed I felt like vomiting
and I could not even drink. Besides that I suffered
of sleeplessness and of strong neurasthenic pains.</p>

<p>Finally I had to give up work for a year and I
spent four months of that time in the country but
my condition did not improve very much.</p>

<p>It caused me a great deal of tension to suppress
my strong sexual impulses. Contact with a public
woman seemed shameful to me, and with a good girl
I could not enter into any intimate relations partly
for moral reasons and partly on account of lack of
favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>I felt inhibited from the moment my illness began.
I decided to resort to public women upon the express
advice of a physician.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This remarkable case is as clear as a school
problem and richly illustrates the various factors
which determine a person’s attitude regarding sexual
matters. The subject is a simple man who has
not yet mastered completely the German language
and he has repressed but little. His youth and
his sexual struggles apparently stretch before his
memory like an open book. He has had many
dreams and remembers them well. We note the
genuine religious background. He is no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
pious and does not care to go to church service.
Nevertheless it ought not to be difficult to perceive
that back of his fear of immoral acts stands
the fear of divine punishment,—a consequence of
his early moral training. This man has been
brought up with fear in his heart. This breeding
of the germ of fear in his soul was responsible
for his anxiety neurosis. Witches appeared to admonish
him, in the school he was spurred on by dire
threats to do his best. Then there was his powerful
sexual craving which he, nevertheless, found possible
to withstand. Whence did he acquire the
strength to keep away from his girl cousin, although
she so warmly attracted him and even encouraged
him? Was it the proximity of his sister
who occupied the same room? Some occurrences
between him and that sister he had overlooked in his
voluntary account of his life, otherwise fairly accurate.
He avoided incest, but besides the moral
and religious inhibitions, there must have been something
more to keep him so effectively away from
women. His trouble which asserts itself before
keeping a secret appointment is nausea. Dislike
and fear are protective defences against sinning.
We recognize readily this disgust for woman, so
strongly emphasized by most genuine homosexuals.
We know that this aversion covers a repressed craving,
a craving which is unbearable to consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
for one reason or another and therefore breaks out
in the negative form as disgust. The latter serves
as defence and protection against the very tendencies
which generate the powerful cravings.</p>

<p>The disturbance is a cover for the incest motive.
He cannot approach a woman because he sees in her
the grandmother, the mother, or the sister, a fact of
which he was often fully aware. <i>Quo me vertam?</i>
There is open before him the homosexual path, since
the road to woman is closed. The episode with the
teacher, the “vile doings” with his school companions
were a sort of initiation.... Here repression sets
in. He knows nothing about his homosexuality.
But the dream betrays and tells more than the
subject is prepared to see as yet. We shall therefore
begin the analysis with an analysis of the dream.</p>


<p><i>That Night’s Dream.</i></p>

<p>I stand before the door of a dwelling in my home
town and gaze upon the surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>While I am immersed in thought, my uncle comes
along; he had helped through the day working in
the field and on his way home stopped near me in
front of the big door; he throws out some jocular
allusions; among other remarks saying: “it would
be healthier for you if you plowed up a few acres
instead of idling away.”</p>

<p>I point to the team of horses hitched to the harrow,
jocularly saying: “oh, yes, certainly, but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
with so poor a team. These two animals should
have been dumped on the scrap heap long ago,
specially this left one bearing himself so proudly
when he is only an old nag.”</p>

<p>I hardly finished my words, when the horse started
and broke his traces madly to jump at me.</p>

<p>I started to run, fled up the first stairway and
ran into the kitchen shutting the door after me.
Then I ran into the next room and barricaded the
door with every furniture article I found handy.
The horse was already at the door kicking until he
broke through and made his way into the room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I ran to another room, again shutting
the door but even as I did so I knew that it wouldn’t
be an effective barrier. I looked around the room
for some other means of escape and to my surprise
saw my sister standing behind me.</p>

<p>The horse had broken down the door enough to be
able to stretch his head through into the room and
his dilated nostrils snorted angrily.</p>

<p>Sister handed me a small round stove calling out
to defend myself with the stove lids, they will prove
an effective weapon.</p>

<p>The horse was ready to jump inside the room so
I hurled at him first the covers then the whole stove
as powerfully as I could. At the last critical
moment I caught sight of another door, hurried
out ran to the stairway and woke up.</p>

<p>I went over the whole dream in my mind to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
sure that I will remember to tell it to my psychoanalyst.
Shortly after that I fell again into a light
slumber and dreamed that I had gone to the analyst
who treats me:</p>

<p>He occupied a commodious residence with broad
stairways. I found myself face to face with him;
he was doing something in a closet. I stood by and
told him the foregoing dream.</p>

<p>He went away for a while to attend to some important
matters, as he had to drive off in about one
half hour. Then he called me down to him and
asked me to continue my story while he was lacing
his shoes.</p>

<p>When I finished I moved off and through a side
door and there I met my mother. I exchanged a
few words with her, opened the door, which led to a
glass-covered veranda and saw a locomotive and
open fire.</p>

<p>The engineer moved various levers in vain, he
could not start the engine. Meanwhile the physician
arrived, looked at his watch, and remarked impatiently
that it is already late. Suddenly a servant
girl comes running down the steps bringing
three carefully tied up paper packages (or bundles).</p>

<p>In order to raise the required steam pressure it
was necessary to feed the fire lively. The physician
decided to help and threw one of the bundles into the
fire. It burned up quickly but produced no effect.</p>

<p>Then mother spoke up from the other side saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
there it must be all right, took another package and
threw it in at that spot without accomplishing anything,
any more than the physician did.</p>

<p>Saying: “That is not the way, look here,” I took
hold of the third package, jumped on a protruding
piece of machinery in the midst of the flame which
surrounded it and threw the bundle into the center
of the burning mass. The flames broke forth, the
safety valve began to whizz, a whistling was heard
and the engine began ponderously to move.</p>

<p>The physician jumped on, reached out his hand
to me as he was moving off and I barely had time to
ask him where he was going. He said he was going
to Brünn. I wondered at that and—woke up again.</p>

<p>After I fell asleep once more I had another dream
like the first. I found myself in an elegantly furnished
residence.</p>

<p>The door opened and a young pretty woman came
in. She looked at me for a while, then smiled
wickedly but I did not lose my poise and said something
to her. She became more irritable, raised her
hand, in which she held a weapon and threatened me.</p>

<p>I looked on quietly, confident that she could not do
a thing to me. Then she jumped at me. I ran to
another room, she pursued me, and thus the chase
continued through several rooms.</p>

<p>I was about to open another door when I felt she
was directly behind me holding in her hands some
instrument that looked like a perolin sprayer. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
squirted a white soapy fluid. She gave a few squirts
without touching me, although a few drops fell on
my clothes. I thought it was some caustic fluid
and wanted to escape.</p>

<p>While she was preparing for a new attack I
quickly shut the door and the nozzle of the sprayer
caught between the door and the frame.</p>

<p>I grasped the nozzle, twisted the sprayer out of
her hand, threw it aside, caught the woman by the
throat, and was going to throw her down. But she
caught me also by the throat, kissed me passionately
and staggered towards a sofa, dragging me along.
I held her with my left arm around her body while
I pushed my right hand between her legs. I felt a
pleasant sensation; as we looked in each other’s eyes
we slid down together....</p>

<p>She was saying she meant no harm, laughed
heartily, pressed me to her bosom, her face began
suddenly to change,—I now saw my sister smiling
at me.</p>

<p>Overcome with affection for her I wanted to press
her closely to me—suddenly the door opened and an
elderly woman came storming in. It scared me and
I awoke—pollution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His first dream carries him to his home town and
birthplace. Our previous analyses have shown us
the meaning of this and no Freudian student will
fail to recognize that the birthplace is a symbol for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
the mother. We learn that the father’s brother
resembles the father and conclude that the uncle
stands for the father in that dream. The conversation
between himself and the uncle is a repetition of
old reproaches. For a long time he was unable to
work and at the present time he is unable to help in
his father’s business. He finds a ready excuse in
his illness. The incestuous relation to his mother
is fairly obvious. The inhibitions which developed
so that he is unable to make himself useful in his
father’s business, are due partly to his hatred of
the father as a rival. The day before the dream he
had a small controversy with his father, because
the latter had made an error in one of his calculations
and was unwilling to acknowledge it. In the
dream he revenges himself for the reproach implied
in his unwillingness to plow (plowing here stands
for coitus) by a slurring reference to his father’s
age. He was no longer fit for marital duties. The
parental couple are too old, they have already lived
too long (“the pair belong on the scrap heap”) and
the one at the left (the father) is but an old jade.
(In German, <i>Mähre</i>, jade, old horse, here is also a
play upon the old home, <i>Mähren</i>). This is followed
by the revenge of the scorned father in the form of
pursuit by the horse.</p>

<p>The dreamer relates that he was fully aware of
his incestuous thoughts with reference to his mother
and sister, only he thought that he had outgrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
them. But he finds that occasionally he still dreams
of contact with his mother and more often with his
sister. On the other hand he did not think the
dreams signified anything, believing that they were
but the echoes of a past stage. He does not remember
having ever dreamed of his father in an
overt sexual connection.</p>

<p>But we recognize the bipolar attitude towards
his father. His trouble must be intimately linked
with an unconquered homosexuality. The account
of his illness now brings up a childhood occurrence
which had made a strong impression on him. There
was a teacher in that home town who had a most
peculiar and extraordinary way of recompensing his
worthy pupils. If one did something praiseworthy
and the teacher was pleased, he said: “very well, my
boy! You shall be honored for this,”—and gave
the boy his erect penis to hold until ejaculation followed.
This was done openly before the whole class.
The teacher carried on this sort of thing until five
years ago without any trouble and then left the
place suddenly, to avoid court trouble as the result
of a complaint. Christoph, who was a special pet
of that teacher, was probably chosen for that honor
more often than any other boy. He was also the
prettiest boy in the class.</p>

<p>Beginning with that experience various episodes
of homosexual character are disclosed extending up
to the time when he was seventeen years of age, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
they suddenly ceased. But he does not know that
these were homosexual acts and still insists that he
always felt only the most terrible aversion towards
“all these homosexual things.” The subject maintains
unconsciously the wish to do with his father
what he had done with his teacher.</p>

<p>He is pursued by homosexual thoughts (the <i>left</i>
horse). We are now turning our attention to the
functional significance of the dream. It represents
a pursuit. The attitude displayed towards the
physician is clear. The physician pursues him
through all his memories (the flight through the
rooms). This flight through rooms has been interpreted
by <i>Freud</i> as a flight from women
(brothel). I have repeatedly pointed out that
rooms represent the compartments of the soul, that
the pursuit is really through all the parts of the
brain (the upper story stands for brain; compare
the colloquialism, there is something the matter with
some one’s “upper story”). We see that a certain
thought pursues him past all obstacles and
hindrances, and he is unable to elude that searching
thought. His sister is the one who comes to his aid.
She hands him a miniature stove with which to defend
himself against the horse. The stove and the
lids represent the sister’s sex.... The dream
means: <i>only your sister, only a woman can save you
from your homosexual inclination towards your
father</i>. The dream also indicates a prospective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
tendency: he throws the sister upon the father and
saves himself through another door. He means to
overcome his complexes. The attitude towards the
physician is also clear: he expects to put me off his
trail by confessing to me his incest fancies about his
sister, when I had not asked him about it. The
dream indicates his intention of telling me about his
fancies and episodes in which his sister figures. But
he expects to escape thereby any further inquiry
into his wish phantasies and to avoid telling me about
his attitude towards his parents.</p>

<p>Then the patient falls asleep again and repeats the
dream so as to be able to tell it. We may presume
that the dream was distorted and changed somewhat
in the course of its first rendition. We really get
but an extract, the chief parts omitted.... In the
next dream he tells me the first dream. Such dreams
are seldom remembered. When a woman dreams
that she has told her physician the dream, it means
that she is through with the unpleasant task and the
dream vanishes from memory as in the cases when
the patients declare: Today I dreamed something
important; I said to myself in my half slumber:
“This is something I must tell the doctor! I don’t
remember what it was. But it was something really
significant.” Thus is the physician thwarted; the
resistance is vicariously overcome in the dream, the
wish to tell the dream is fulfilled but the wish to keep
it from the physician is stronger; during his dream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
experience both tendencies are given expression by
the subject.</p>

<p>The next dream: Again, an exposition of analysis.
I am upstairs busy with a closet, which represents
the brain or his shut-up soul. But the analysis will
not last long. The wild hunting after his secrets
and treasures will cease soon. The physician has
to leave (die?). Here the physician substitutes the
father. The dream shows plainly the transference
from the father to the physician. The first dream
dramatizes the pursuit of the father, in the second
and third the father no longer figures. His name
is not mentioned at all in the dream, he is the secret,
the unspeakable theme.... The physician laces his
shoes; that is commonly known as a death symbol
and shows the clear wish to be through with the
analysis.</p>

<p>An engine has to be started. He is a machinist
and has daily to do with machines. Engine is
symbol for his soul which functions so poorly, a
symbol for himself, for all the impulses and energies
within him. He accomplishes through his own
powers what his physician and his mother are unable
to bring about. First I try to put the engine in motion.
I take the mysterious paper package and
throw it on; the mother attends to the other side of
the fire. But he gets up and takes care of the fire
from above.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He is above, he triumphs over me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
surpasses me in the ability to cure him. He recalls
a pupil of his who had to commute to Brünn.
It brings to his mind an occasion when he was the
teacher. Thus I am his pupil, I am learning from
him how to start an engine. Though I may know
something about sick souls, I don’t understand a
thing about his specialty (he is a machinist), there
he is the master and I am ignorant. This consoling
thought serves to strengthen his feeling of self-regard
and prevents a feeling of inferiority from developing
in his relations to me. There are a number
of scornful references to the impotent father and to
the equally unskilful physician. He is with me one
half hour daily. He had noticed that I looked at the
watch, to see whether his time was up. The half
hour and the looking at the watch appear in the
dream. The day before he showed his father how a
technical problem was solved. In this dream he
also shows me that something must be done a particular
way.</p>

<p>We observe that this attitude towards the
physician, as representative of the father, pervades
the whole dream. But this does not exhaust the
meaning of the dream. It is a pollution dream
(gratification without responsibility). It is interesting
to see how the onanistic act, represented
as pollution, is dramatized in the dreams. In the
first dream he flees from homosexuality and there
the relationship between homosexuality and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
hidden mother complex is clearly shown. In the
second dream the mechanism of sexuality is represented
in action. Neither the father (the engineer
working around the engine), the mother nor the
physician can do it. He alone is able to accomplish
it. This shows the secret pride of the masturbator,
the self-sufficiency of the autoerotic personality.
(The engine’s flame covered running board, a phallic
symbol; later note.) Onanism is shown as a protection
against all sexual perils. The safety valve
hisses and relieves itself—an intimation of the subsequent
pollution.</p>

<p>But the fear of onanism, the strong effects, the
dread of homosexuality and incest wake him from
his sleep. Consciousness (the engine conductor)
attempts to control the thoughts and to banish the
nocturnal ghosts. The thoughts about a man and
about his sister are interrupted and he falls asleep
once more. Three times he dreams of various situations
before the anxiety in him is transformed into
wish. First he fled from the horse and from his
sister, then he fled from his mother and the physician
and finally there came his release. He was
strong enough to withstand his homosexuality,
strong to overcome the heterosexual longings. Now
the instinct throws forward its highest and strongest
card to overcome the last inhibitions: bisexuality.
The girl with the phallus, his sister, appears ...
and pursues him. He is frankly preoccupied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
the thought: give in and masturbate. The thought
itself he avoids, he tries to push out of his mind.
He sees himself in the dream. He sees the womanly
side of himself, the woman with the phallus, and this
thought troubles him during the nightly hours when
he should be resting. He jumps at the female person
to strangle her: that is how he fights with his instinct,
how he tries to thwart his autoerotism. The
instinct recognizes the weakness of his defence and
suggests that it seeks only his welfare. With the
right hand he seizes his genitals while with the left
he carries out an embrace. He has an orgasm (the
sister smiles at him) but it does not last long; for
an old woman appears upon the scene. The door
opens, that is, the door of conscience (the threshold
symbolism of <i>Silberer</i>), and remorse seizes his soul.
He rouses from his sleep and the pollution worries
him. The old woman may also be a symbol for his
mother (further significance of the old woman as
symbol will be shown later). But I have no proof
of that inasmuch as the subject describes her otherwise.</p>

<p>What is the sense of the dream with reference to
its central theme? Is it a wish-fulfillment, a warning,
or a prophecy? Undoubtedly many wishes are
fulfilled in this dream. The subject resists many
temptations, he embraces his sister, he triumphs over
his father and over his physician as well. But the
most important feature that the dream portrays is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
the pollution as a defence against all sexual dangers
and as successful cover for all inner inhibitions.</p>

<p>Another meaning of the dream should be pointed
out. His neurosis must be represented by some person
or object in the dream. Asked what the engine
suggests to his mind the subject answers: my illness.
The glass-covered porch: the transparency of his
trouble; the engine: his neurosis. The subject
habitually compares his body to a steam engine, especially
his stomach. He shows various effects of
starvation: unable to eat, he loses weight, and
looks like a skeleton because he wants to starve out
his sexual longing and punish himself for his sinful
passions. This man had built for himself a marvelous
safety valve in his neurosis. When he thinks
of going to meet a girl, he gets such a severe attack
of gastric pain that he must give up the appointment.
The gastric discomfort is induced beforehand
through excitement and inability to eat. The
clever staging of his gastric trouble is noteworthy.
Nausea and vomiting are first induced to prevent the
taking of food. Then hunger supervenes and that
gnawing sense of hunger, spoken of as gastric
cramps, becoming so strong as to overshadow the
heart affair. The craving for food becomes more
obsessive than the desire for woman. These episodes
are followed by a ravenous appetite.</p>

<p>He recalls that after the first dream he woke up
with a terrible hunger. This hunger was even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
stronger after the second dream but disappeared
after the pollution.</p>

<p>I have already maintained in my work on <i>Morbid
Anxiety</i> that hunger may stand as a substitute for
sexual libido and here this is clearly shown and illustrated.</p>

<p>Now we understand the firing of the engine with
the paper packages. The caloric value of paper is
as small as that of nutrition, when the latter is substituted
for sexual desire. Thus he makes use of
his stomach as a remarkable safety valve. He
starves himself out because the gratification of food
serves as a substitute for sexual gratification. He
relates a number of incidents showing how cleverly
his neurosis serves him. Every woman he meets excites
him but even when he goes so far as to arrange
an appointment with one and she agrees to call at his
residence or to go to a hotel he stops short of actual
intimacy.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the analysis the prognosis
is unfavorable. He does not want to give up the
neurosis, his safety valve, he wants to keep up his
own way of “firing the engine” and wishes the physician
were out of the way. Indeed, he continues to
have recourse to masturbation, he endures the consequent
regrets and self reproaches, rather than give
up his defence.</p>

<p>We observe inwardly a strong “will to power” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
formally a decidedly feminine attitude; the orgasm
occurs while he plays the role of woman; but the
highest gratification always depends on the most
powerful inner forces. He does not avoid women
because he fears defeat, for he has repeatedly
proven his <i>potentia</i> through intercourse with prostitutes
and feels supremely confident that he could
master any situation involving no moral scruples.
What hinders him seems to be the association of his
sister with all decent girls, and of his mother with
all married women. His homosexuality is inhibited
by his fixation on the father. And back of all inhibitions
there stands his overstressed religiosity,
which he had cultivated for years although he had
apparently outgrown it. He intended to embrace a
religious career but gave up the idea when he was 14
years of age. It is very likely that most of his
troubles will disappear after marriage, if he should
break away from the parental circle.</p>

<p>I believe that even one who is inexperienced in
dream analysis will readily recognize a phallic symbol
in the perolin sprayer which gives forth a soapy
fluid. It was natural that at 16 years of age he
should fall in love with a colleague who resembled
a sister. The obvious incest thoughts kept him
from the girl. All girls of good family were sisters;
he treated them like sisters. The prostitutes were
not in the same class with his sister and he could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
potent with them. The homosexual path was closed
to him also on account of his sister. In all young
men he saw his sister with a phallus.</p>

<p>It is significant that further analysis discloses a
fixation upon the father to an extent I had not
quite suspected before. Back of the apparent scorn
of his father, underneath his tendency to speak
lightly of him there was an unquenchable love which
nothing could quite gratify. The ugly example
given by his teacher suggested intimacies possible
only in the realm of phantasy. (His subsequent
dreams placed him with me in a similar situation.)
Thus he vacillated between homosexuality and Don
Juanism.</p>

<p>Why do these men hesitate in the end and why do
they not become genuine Don Juans? In large
measure this is due to the inner religious scruples.
These rudimentary types are weighted down by an
excess of morality. They like to play at immorality
but very carefully see to it that morality wins in the
end.</p>

<p>I wish to add a few remarks about the religious
significance of the dream. It is remarkable that all
dream interpreters have overlooked the obvious import
of dreams, from the religious standpoint, in
spite of the fact that they are aware of the great
role which religion plays in man’s mental life and
must appreciate that such a force necessarily finds
expression through the dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>The subject has been for years a very pious young
man. Witches and devils filled his fancies as real
tempters. The dream also shows the fear of the
devil who misleads the weak to drink, whoredom,
shortly, into sin. The homosexual tendency is often
felt as the work of the devil.</p>

<p>Our subject who was so very pious for a long time,
declaring himself now an atheist and free thinker.
He promised his mother, under oath, that he would
attend church services regularly on Sundays but he
gave this up when he reached the 20th year. At
first his mother objected, and was very angry over
it, and desisted only after her son convinced her that
he had no faith. But she said repeatedly: “I feel
certain that the Lord will enlighten you and that
some day you will come back to the faith.” He only
smiled at that for on his part he felt certain that he
would never again be a believer. His greatmother,
whom he visited every summer, was even more pious.
Two weeks after the dream we analyzed he had the
following dream:</p>

<p><i>I am with my grandmother. She goes early
in the morning to church and asks me to go along. I
hesitate. Next morning she repeats the request. I
have a strong attack of gastric pains and tell her.
I will take a sunbath, it is the same thing....</i></p>

<p>We see that, under the grandmother’s request, the
dream portrays the subject’s childhood disposition.
We note a connection between the hesitation to go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
church and the gastric pains and we hear of sunbaths
as a substitute for religion,—a fact which I
have repeatedly observed in other cases as well.</p>

<p>Further inquiry reveals that every evening the
patient struggles with the impulse to recite “Our
Father”; he resents the inclination,—“it is nonsense.
I don’t believe any such folly as that.” Nevertheless
sometimes he murmurs portions of the prayer, while
in a half dreamy state, when he has the illusion of
being again a child. He carries around in his
pocket, a couple of small “holy mother medallions”
which he bought at a fair: “it is really a superstition;
I always carry them in my coin purse, because
I have an idea it is good luck.” He has presented
his prayer book to his younger sister and so the
book is always accessible. He goes to churches because
he is “interested in the church music.” ...</p>

<p>How does the dream show this? The devil appears
to him in the shape of a horse (horse’s hoof
is a characteristic sign of the devil) and tries to seduce
him. The horse breaks down doors and all
obstacles. At one time he believed in a personal devil.
He attended once a church where the minister
preached considerably about the devil and who said
that there were living witnesses to testify that they
had seen the devil. His grandfather was angry
because the minister told believers such far-fetched
stories, and forbade him going to that church. But
the fear of a personal devil had been deeply im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>planted
in him at home. If he misbehaved, he was
threatened with the evil one. If he refused to pray
some one knocked in the next room and he was told
that it was the devil that was after him. He was
brought up the same way to believe in witches. An
ugly old woman once came to his room dressed as a
witch to scare him and the other children into better
behavior and it affected him so horribly that he remembered
the scare for years. In his dream the
devil pursues him and he eludes the pursuit. In the
second part of the dream he himself is the devil and
can do charms. To do magic was his highest ambition
in his youth and he would have gladly given
himself up to the devil for the privilege of learning
magic. He starts the engine by means of a charm.
In his childhood his great wish was to build a magic
locomotive with which he could travel wherever he
wanted.</p>

<p>The servant girl who brings down three bales of
paper (play on trinity?), (his love letters?), is a
symbol of the Holy Virgin, as it is in all dreams, a
fact which I could easily prove. He was a confirmed
admirer of the Holy Mother. He must give
this up if he is to learn magic. But the dream is a
compromise between the two tendencies and expresses
a bipolar attitude; he fires the engine with
divine fuel, with faith, which upholds his life along
the right path and protects it. He wishes me to
the devil that he may continue secretly to cling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
his religion. But the infantile wish to be a magician
comes foremost to the surface. (The dream does
not portray one wish, but a number of wishes which
criss-cross the soul.) The supplementary portion
of the lengthy dream also illustrates the power of
magic. The religious meaning of spraying (with
holy water ... Perolin cleanses and disinfects the
air) is readily obvious and so is also the admixture
of religious and sexual motives which play such a
tremendous role in the neuroses and the psychoses.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
He yields to the temptation, a she-devil seduces him.
The old woman, after all, is the witch of his childhood,
coming to punish him for his sins. (He admits
also a strong gerontophilia and once he fell in
love with a 60-year-old woman).</p>

<p>The old and the new testament, his prayer books,
his confession slips, are in the paper packages which
he must burn up to free himself of all religious inhibitions.</p>

<p>The dream thus portrays a prospective tendency,—the
overcoming religious inhibitions, subduing the
dread of hell and devil as well as the fear of witches
so as to give himself up to his cravings. He takes
his life in his own hands, fires his own engine,—he
will take unto himself any woman who looks like his
sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>The dream expresses clearly also that his homosexual
fixation is due to the mother and sister Imago
which he finds in all women. Finding himself upon a
sexual path which leads away from women and in
the direction of man, he wants to leave that path and
become a normal man by overcoming all inhibitions.
He no longer requires the protection of his neurosis,
he is master of himself, scorns the religious imperatives,
becoming magician and God in his own
right.</p>

<p>Through the history of this subject we obtain
a glimpse into the mechanism which eventually leads
to homosexuality. This subject might have become
a homosexual and would have then presented the
usual homosexual life history: Very tender for a
time, girl-like, played with dolls at his grandmother’s
house, liked to be busy in the kitchen and preferred
the company of girls. Such experiences are commonly
shared also by the heterosexual persons but
the latter forget them. Later, if the course of development
favors the outbreak of homosexuality,
these recollections, emphasized and fixed through
repetition are pointed out as proof that the condition
is inborn.</p>

<p>One episode in our subject’s life might have led
him to overt homosexuality: his experience with the
teacher,—the more so as it took place openly. But
what amounts to an inciting factor in one case may
act as a deterrent in another. Every influence may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
assert itself either on the negative or positive side.
Childhood dreams as carried out by adults, may
generate either a gerontophilia, or a similar inclination
towards children, depending on whether the subject
assumes the role of the adult or of the younger
person. Fixation on the mother may drive a man
entirely to homosexuality as I have clearly learned
through the history of a certain case. The homosexuals
frequently have a morbid mother, a woman
who suffers of depression and is unwise in her
actions. Unfortunately my observations indicate
that the fancies are generated by parents as often as
they are incited by guilty servants and that such occurrences
are far from rare.</p>

<p>In the case under consideration the experience
with the teacher and the latter’s revolting openness
about it acted as an inhibition to homosexuality.
The thought, “You may get to be like that teacher,”
acted as a deterrent against the outbreak of a so-called
genuine homosexuality, though all conditions
were otherwise favorable. Even the characteristic
dislike of women was there as well as the incestuous
fixation upon the female members of the family.</p>

<p>And although much of his sexual life was perfectly
clear to this subject’s mind, including things
which to others appear only in the dim light of day
dreaming or upon the lowered state of threshold
consciousness, there was one thing about which he
was entirely ignorant: his true attitude towards, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
relationship to, his father. He was continually
more irritated with his father and avoided to be
alone with him because he knew how easily they
break into a quarrel and how misunderstanding
would arise between them on the slightest provocation.
This hypersensitiveness in his relations with
his father, shows that there were feelings at work
over which he was not master. What he demanded
and expected of his father I have already
indicated. He wanted to be treated by him as he
had been treated by his teacher. In the course of
the analysis he also had a dream during which I was
the one assuming that role. He is homosexually
fixed on his father and heterosexually fixed upon the
female members of his family.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see that the homosexual inclination,
despite all childhood experiences, is repressed
and masked under the feeling of disgust.
We understand in this light the meaning of the
gastric pains. He thinks only of women and is a
typical instance of a would-be Don Juan. He
begins numerous adventures but always meets difficulties.
That is, he starts relations which from the
beginning present these difficulties and in that way
there is no danger for him. If the difficulties (symbol
of the unattainable, that is of the incestuous
goal) are overcome, the attraction disappears or
else his protective defence comes to his aid: the
gastric attacks. He goes so far as to take a girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
to a room but at the last moment he can do nothing
on account of his gastric pain. The nausea is a
sign of disgust. It is brought about by the homosexual
tendency pressing forward as much as by the
subject’s inhibition against heterosexual relationship.
At the most critical time before meeting the
girl he is restless, and a voice within seems to say
to him: “you do not really want this woman, you
want a man, like that teacher, or that friend of
yours!” As a protection against these homosexual
notions his nausea comes up and this also acts as a
defence against women. For woman, as such, he
feels no dislike, he is able to have intercourse with
prostitutes, without aversion. But homosexual
acts are repulsive to him. Thus he remains hanging
midway between homosexuality and heterosexuality.
On account of his religious scruples
both pathways are closed to him and the result is—his
ascetic behavior at the end.</p>

<p>His asceticism is back of the rudimentary Don
Juan role which he plays but cannot carry out in
accordance with his instinctive promptings on account
of his inhibitions. One step nearer and we
have the Don Juan of day-dreams and ascetic in
fact,—if the adventures with women are not even
begun. A step further advanced is represented by
the complete repression of all sexual inclinations.
We may define the ascete as a person who remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
in the narcissistic stage of fixation because both
paths of allerotism (that is, homo-, and heterosexuality)
are equally closed to him. An exclusive
monosexual goal is incapable of rousing the instinctive
excitation necessary for carrying out a
sexual act, because the religious scruples are oppressive.
His perennially unattainable ideal is a bisexual
being, he longs for a passion so strong that
it should be capable of overcoming all obstacles. His
asceticism is not voluntary, but a state induced by
his sexual constellation.</p>

<p>Our subject has found his sexual ideal in the dream
world. That is a sister who has a phallus. He, the
valiant warrior, struggles against his instinctive
promptings and masturbates. This act acquires in
his conscious mind, as pollution, the character of
an involuntary act, an accidental occurrence which
cannot be helped, thus being robbed of its significance.</p>

<p><i>Freud</i> points out rightly that the psychologist is
particularly interested in cases showing a late development
of homosexuality,—a condition which
<i>Krafft-Ebing</i> has described as “<i>tardive</i>” or Late
Homosexuality. In such cases homosexuality develops
after a period of hetero-, or bisexuality.
We will describe a number of cases of late homosexuality
elsewhere and then we shall also attempt
to trace the reasons for the occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The next case also represents a transitional
stage showing us a woman in the throes of a struggle
between the two tendencies. We have here a rudimentary,
a would-be Messalina, an interesting female
counterpart to the case described above.</p>

<p>Miss Wanda K. complains of an unfortunate split
in her mental make-up which prevents her from enjoying
life as she should. She suffers of strong and
uncontrollable vomiting but the trouble arises only
when she is about to keep an appointment. She
holds the most liberal views that “a modern girl can
and should have.” She meets gladly men who interest
her and even those who rouse her sexually.
She knows she will never marry. She is 29 years
old and although still very pretty and attractive,—how
long will this last? She wants to enjoy life,
she would not care to die without having tasted the
supreme gift and prize of life, love. But she has a
“delicate” stomach which interferes at the most
critical moment. Here is an example:</p>

<p>“Last Sunday I was to take an excursion with a
gentleman whom I met in an unconventional way.
I am not at all prudish and do not mind being
spoken to on the street. As I walk downtown often
I think to myself: will someone talk to me this time?
I try to attract attention, just a little, and return
home disappointed if no one notices me. A few
weeks ago a very elegant elderly gentleman addressed
me on such an occasion. He is a very intel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>lectual
man, which is the chief consideration with
me. I like intercourse only with intellectual persons.
Persons lacking culture are a trial to me. We entertained
ourselves very pleasantly and since then
we meet daily. When the store where I am employed
closes at the end of the day, I find him already waiting
for me at the street corner. Then we go for a
walk and we talk about all sorts of things. He has
never dared yet mention anything erotic in our conversation.
I have no reason, therefore, to fear him.
Nevertheless I am watching and waiting eagerly for
the opportunity to show him that I am a modern
girl, unafraid of anything when she finds a man
sympathetic and to her liking, if he should ever
begin. I do not expect anything more. One cannot
fall in love all of a sudden! Now, we promise
ourselves an excursion around Vienna for Sunday.
Saturday I feel very excited, and I picture to myself
how he is going to bring up sexual matters, how he
will kiss me in the woods, I already plan what I shall
say to him, how I will resist him, just a little, and
finally give in. You will excuse me. It is high time
that I quit being an old maid. Is that not a pity,
at twenty-nine? At the office where I am employed
all the girls have a sweetheart and some have several
at once. That keeps going through my mind. I
am very excited and I even whistle a tune. But at
the evening meal I am unable to swallow a morsel of
foods. My stomach seems shut tight. Nothing will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
go down. I hope it will be over in the morning.
I get up early, put on my excursion suit and want to
have my breakfast. I struggle with nausea, try to
eat some breakfast, only to vomit promptly every
particle of the food. Then the terrible nausea continues
and keeps up so that I must stay home while
the gentleman waits in vain for me at the appointed
spot. Naturally when this happens a second time
he drops me ... unfortunately it ends just that
way every time.”</p>

<p>She relates numberless occurrences of this character
which always end in uncontrollable nausea and
vomiting. She has a long list of admirers, young
and old, rich and poor, educated and some less so,
every one thinking he can conquer her as she is very
free and open in her talk and does not avoid sexual
topics in her conversations with them. She is a
member of various women’s organizations, like
<i>Mutterschutz</i>, which is devoted to the protection of
the unmarried mother, she is a champion for
women’s sexual freedom and also a Shannaist. But
every one of the men she dangles on her string who
tries to pass from theory to cold fact discovers,
much to his astonishment, that there is quite a difference
between this woman’s views and her practical
conduct. She circumvents all occasions which
might prove embarrassing to her. An office colleague
invites her to his home. He is an art collector,
she is interested in painting, and he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
like to show her his collection. She finds all sorts of
excuses to postpone accepting his invitation and
finally appears at his house ... accompanied by a
girl friend.... She had dwelt so much on all the
possible consequences of a visit of this kind that at
the last moment she lost her courage.</p>

<p>It is interesting that her mental state developed
first after an engagement. Until the age of 23 she
was fairly normal, very much like any other girl.
At that age she made the acquaintance of a man of
good standing in whom she became much interested.
She became engaged to him and this made her happy
for she was in love as much as any girl could be who
thought she had found her ideal.</p>

<p>The man had but one serious fault. He was tremendously
jealous. He tortured her with questions
about her whole past life and she had to relate to him
with particularity everything that she had experienced
as a girl. She frankly told him that once
she was in love with her piano teacher and also with
her school teacher, a girl, but that there was nothing
else of any significance in her life. Nevertheless he
kept torturing her with further questionings insisting
that she must tell everything before marriage and
he will forgive her absolutely everything, but he did
not want to be deceived, he wanted perfect candor
and truth between them.</p>

<p>One night she woke from a dream in which her
brother and she had figured in a rather intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
role. This brought to her mind an occurrence she
had entirely forgotten. She was visiting her married
brother in the country. His wife had gone to
some relatives and he suggested that she should sleep
in his wife’s bed. She did so without having any
particular erotic notions, since this was her brother
with whom she had always been frank, not as she
was with her other brothers, for she had four others.
During the night she felt her brother’s hand touching
her. He crawled in to her bed and kissed her.
She was sleepy and thought she was dreaming. He
kissed her again and sleepy as she was, she responded.
They embraced warmly. She knows that
she took hold of his <i>membrum</i>. She thinks her
brother must have exercised wonderful control over
himself after that and that he crawled back in his
own bed. The whole experience of that night is
rather unclear. That much she is certain, no coitus
took place.</p>

<p>This remembrance awed her for she knew then
that she had lied to her man. It happened only
once for next day she left the place and her own
brother advised her to do it. She went to visit a
friend of hers in the neighborhood and returned
only after her sister-in-law was back home. But
since her young man had such complete faith in her,
she felt that she must tell him the whole truth. She
told him of the occurrence relating how it took place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
as in a dream. He began to investigate and to question
until it drove her to distraction and there were
times when she herself wavered in her recollection as
to what really occurred. But she could only repeat
the one thing: she knew positively that they
kissed and touched each other that night, but could
not say that between her brother and herself matters
had gone beyond that.</p>

<p>Her bridegroom stayed away a few days. Then
she received from him a note stating that he does not
feel that he can take her to the altar after her confession
and he considers himself therefore a free
man. He sent her back the engagement ring and
demanded the return of all his gifts and letters.</p>

<p>This was like a physical blow to her. That was
the thanks she received for her complete candor!
She had taken at his word the man whom she dearly
loved. How could she help thinking that he merely
sought an excuse in her eyes, and in his own, a pretext
to declare himself free?</p>

<p>For a time after that she hated all men. She
made no exception, including in her hatred even that
brother who was responsible for her misfortune, in
the first place.</p>

<p>Then she arrived at a second deduction: “it is
not worth while to be honorable! Better be easy
going, like all your women friends!”</p>

<p>Shortly after that she apparently ceased hating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
all men and her great yearning began causing her to
think continually of nothing but men. At the same
time there began also her uncontrollable vomiting.</p>

<p>It seemed that her tremendous inclination to love
was struggling with an equally powerful antagonism.
During that difficult period her only consolation was
a woman friend and her sister to whom she felt herself
very closely attached.</p>

<p>But her dreams show that back of her running
after men there was something else: the homosexual
instinct which was struggling powerfully to come
to surface and which she tried to hold back by her
love affairs with men. She showed a number of unmistakable
signs. She dressed simply and rather
mannishly; she cut her hair short, and began smoking
cigarettes; her appearance and gait assumed
more and more a mannish form; she lost her mildness
and soft nature becoming hardened and strong. Her
whole nature expressed one supreme wish: <i>I want to
be a man, he has a better life!</i> And, strange enough!
Now she does attract men and they dangle after her
by the dozen. But she only played and when it came
to a serious issue in the course of any of her adventures,—for
some of the men had earnest intentions,—she
deliberately turned the whole thing into
a huge joke.</p>

<p>She was no longer lured by men alone. She was
on the point of becoming overtly homosexual passing
through the last phase of the struggle. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
nausea stood more and more clearly as a protection
and defence against the homosexual inclination. Her
dreams were filled with homosexual episodes. She
herself was astonished when she began to observe her
dreams. The very first dream she related concerned
her sister and her friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I am with my friend on the</i> Gaensehäufel <i>(a popular
promenade on the Danube embankment in Vienna)
and we are naked; I say: How beautiful you are!
You are more beautiful than any man. She embraces
me and kisses me on the breast, on the spot
where I am so sensitive. I wake up with dread,—palpitation
of the heart and nausea.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Other dreams represent endless variants of this
theme. Men figure in them but seldom. Occasionally
she is pursued by them and flees to her sister
or her friend. Thus her conflict is also shown in
her dreams as a flight away from men, an escape
through homosexuality.</p>

<p>This young woman also imagined herself to be a
radical although inwardly she was pious. Sundays
she visited the church, to hear the music, she was
not a believer, but occasionally she prayed, because
it was an old habit, she was fond of reading the Bible
and she had to suppress a small inner voice which
impelled her to go to confession. One day she said
to me: “Do you know, yesterday it occurred to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
that if I were again a believer and could go to confession,
everything would be all right....”</p>

<p>Here we see a young woman who was at first on
the proper path to become a normal, heterosexual
woman. She experiences a serious trauma and begins
to despise all men. She turns away from them.
This aversion is favored by the fact that all men
remind her of the love for her brother, which was
repressed and forgotten but which flared up again
on the occasion of her unfortunate experience. That
was the reason why she was able to entertain herself
best with elderly gentlemen and go on excursions
with them, etc., without being overcome with nausea.
The danger was not so great and these men were
less typical of her brother.... She turns away
from men and her sexuality flows into another channel.
We have therefore a regression back to a
childhood phase, apparently past and gone, in
<i>Freud’s</i> sense. She also becomes more agreeable at
home, where during the past years she had been
accustomed to pay no attention to her mother. She
again becomes fixed upon her family and turns once
more to her childhood piety. The period of her
nausea represents the last stage in her struggle
against homosexuality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As we glance over the three cases just analyzed
we are impressed in the first place by the powerful
rôle of the inner religiosity, which often passes un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>recognized.
Both men stood upon that emotional
level which leads to polygamy as a defence against
homosexuality. But they were unable to overcome
their religious scruples. Too weak openly to embrace
asceticism, they wandered through complicated
neurotic by-paths in the attempt to circumvent all
the dangers that threatened them. One of them
played very cleverly the rôle of ‘<i>Pechvogel</i>,’—a man
who would gladly be a libertine but who was not
lucky enough to succeed,—the other was prevented
by his stomach trouble from abandoning the path of
virtue.</p>

<p>The counterpart is the “modern girl” who dreams
about free love and mother-rights and at the same
time generates a nervous nausea as a defence against
any danger to her virtue. Here again we must admire
the subtlety of the neurotic who finds such clever
means to assume a certain rôle in the eyes of the
world no less than before himself, in order to cover
up his true nature. All men who really lack inner
freedom are overanxious to act as if they were free.
They apparently adopt some modern liberal principle
while as a matter of fact secretly they adhere
to the religious scruples of their ancestors.</p>

<p>As a great sin and “unnatural” act, it is plain
that homosexuality was out of question in these
cases. Religion acts here as protection and outlet
at the same time. But it is also clear that under
an other educational régime these men would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
found open to them two paths neither of which they
were able to choose under the existing inhibitions.</p>

<p>The woman may become overtly homosexual and
some late episodes indicate that her resistance to the
homosexual longings may yet be overcome. In this
case the traumatic incident which turned her against
all men did not occur during early childhood. It is
a great error to assume that traumas of late occurrence
lose their pathogenic rôle.</p>

<p>There are periods in our life when we are impervious
to traumas. But there are also times during
which we are hypersensitive to any influences
which play upon us. Every decennium of our life
has its crises and morbid periods during which we
show a peculiar sensitiveness.</p>

<p>Experience in the course of psychoanalysis has
shown us that the recollections as told by the subjects
are partial and incomplete.</p>

<p>The repressed memories and all those images which
the subjects are unwilling at first to see come to
surface only after weeks of analysis. Then the subjects
are astonished to discover that they did not
really know themselves. The solution of our problem
appears to depend on the successful analysis
of a large number of homosexuals. Meanwhile there
are a number of striking facts which every psychoanalyst
can verify and which those who uphold the
theory that homosexuality is inborn look upon as
proof of their contention that homosexuality is truly
hereditary: most homosexuals are apparently well
satisfied with their condition and do not particularly
care to be cured of it. They call on the analyst only
after they come into conflict with the law or if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
fear such a conflict. They do not want to have
heterosexual feelings, they are proud of their condition
and they always insist that social ostracism
alone is what makes their status an unhappy one.
They belong to those remarkable persons who refuse
to appreciate their plight. Hence the customary
statement: since I began homosexual relations I am
happy. I desire nothing else! Only a small number
retain any desire for “wife and child” and for
normal relations, but even those fear it as much as
the “manly hero,” proud of his homosexuality.</p>

<p>We must not forget that exclusive homosexuality
is the end result of a long and tortuous psychic
process, a sort of self-healing process in the midst
of a quasi-insoluble conflict. The dangerous heterosexual
path is apparently blocked altogether, because
certain inhibitions stand actively in the way.
The removal of the inhibitions renews the acute
character of the conflict,—it means changing a state
of truce for a state of active warfare. The homosexual
finds in his condition a makeshift for peace
and quiet. It is a poor peace, to be sure, for the
heterosexual inclinations are still powerful enough
to generate neurotic symptoms. But it is a safety
outlet and anxiety prevents its abandon. Just as
the woman seized with fear of open spaces (agoraphobia)
finally refuses to leave the house and thus
avoids her anxiety only to experience the attacks
of anxiety again the moment she endeavors to step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
out of the circumscribed area of peace,—the moment
she endeavors to go beyond the sphere within
which her inner voice keeps quiet,—so the homosexual
feels once more the full strength of his revulsion
whenever he attempts heterosexual activity.
His customary attitude towards woman is one of
dislike or disgust, she may leave him indifferent, but
never will he admit that—he is afraid of woman.
He would rather assume the mask of indifference;
he may be willing to approach woman but only upon
intellectual grounds, he may even appreciate her as a
friend, but he flees from her as a possible lover.</p>

<p>The homosexual resembles the fetichist in this regard:
he has found his compromise, he has become
accustomed to his limitation and willingly puts up
with his limitation as being something organic, final,
inherited. That is why we usually hear that the
homosexual felt his peculiarity already in his childhood,
that he was from the first unlike the other
children, that he was always “different.”</p>

<p><i>The pride over his condition, the continually repeated
and stressed notion that he is exceptional, the
attitude of contrariness towards what is normal, all
these things render difficult a subsequent correction
of the trouble.</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>How may the homosexual be cured? If he is made
heterosexual he represses his homosexuality and becomes
neurotic for that reason; the endeavor to turn
him bisexual meets the course of social development.
The proper therapic course would be to remove the
inhibitions which stand between him and woman, to
make him de facto again bisexual and heterosexual
for all practical purposes. That is certainly possible
and it may be attained through analysis provided
the subjects have the patience and perseverance
to carry it out. Where the will is lacking no therapist
can accomplish anything. Unfortunately in most
instances the will is absent.</p>

<p>Analysis has taught us how misleading the first
accounts are as obtained from the subjects, how
much they recollect their past in a spirit of partizan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>ship.
Every person carries out a one-sided choice
of remembrances recalling merely what suits a particular
occasion. This came to me as a great surprise
when I first undertook the analysis of a homosexual
especially as at the time my experience was
limited and my knowledge of the technique and my
understanding of resistance very imperfect. At the
time I still believed that the patient wills to get
well; I am convinced today that the will to be ill is
the strongest force which we must fight against.
That first homosexual gave me the usual history,—the
development from early childhood of feelings
exclusively homosexual. My surprise was great
when the subject recalled a large number of heterosexual
experiences in the course of the following
three weeks, all dating from his childhood. I learned
then in one lesson that homosexuality is <i>developmental</i>
and not something <i>inborn</i>; <i>an acquired, not
an inherited character</i>. I was much impressed with
<i>Hirschfeld’s</i> theory of the intermediary stage
(<i>Zwischenstufentheorie</i>) but placed no credence in
this theory and awaited further proofs. At the
First Psychoanalytic Congress, <i>Sadger</i> reported
similar experiences based on psychoanalysis. To be
sure, <i>Sadger</i> conceived the psychogenesis of homosexuality
in rather narrow terms and for a time, I
must confess, I too looked upon the repression of
the mother Imago, which every woman is alleged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
to reproduce, as the sole cause of homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>But my diligent researches extending over a
period of years have since convinced me that this
problem is very complicated and that there are
clearly a number of genetic factors, and that several
of them must and do cooperate in every instance
to bring about the thwarting of the heterosexual and
the enlargement of the homosexual craving.</p>

<p>It occurred to me at first that in many cases the
inhibitions may disappear also in the homosexual
leading him to become again a heterosexual person.
Every one who has had any experience with the
homosexual knows that occasionally a genuine homosexual
may change and fall in love unexpectedly
with a woman or he even marries and after that
continues as a normal person. Thus, for instance,
<i>Tarnovsky</i>, in his work, “<i>The Morbid Manifestations
of the Sexual Instinct</i>,” states:<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> “I know a pederast
who maintained relations almost exclusively with
young boys; at a relatively advanced age he fell
passionately in love with a young girl, whom he
married and with whom he had children. He was able
to carry out sexual relations with his wife only
because her face resembled that of a young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
whom he once loved.” A rationalisation of that
kind, such a transformation, may be seen here
and there. It is quite likely that the young man,
whom <i>Tarnovsky’s</i> patient once loved, in turn resembled
the homosexual’s sister or some other beloved
female person and that the subject took that
step to return at last to his first heterosexual ideal.
Only a few days ago there called on me a “confirmed”
homosexual who had suddenly fallen in love with a
cabaret singer whom he wanted to marry. She was
the exact image of a sister of his who had died long
ago. Before this he did not want to hear of contact
with women. Cases of this kind—without any
treatment, of course,—are discussed very heatedly
in homosexual circles and the news is rapidly spread.
The deserter is spoken of as traitor to the holy
cause, he is counted out and banished from the
circle. Anathema sit! Such cases are not infrequent.
But they do not come to the attention of the physician
and if they attract the specialist’s attention,
the latter invariably declares them instances of
“<i>pseudo-homosexuality</i>.” No “genuine” homosexual
would do such a thing! Homosexual physicians, unfortunately,
only add to the confusion on this subject.
They constitute themselves judge and jury at
the same time, but claim to be objective in their
judgment,—they have tried the experiment in their
own case, etc.—Oh, those wonderful psychologists
who know all about their own soul! What have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
not endured from those enthusiasts who imagine that
they have really penetrated the depths of their own
psyche! But any one who has opportunity to
analyze a psychoanalyst is invariably amazed at the
degree of blindness possible where one’s own attitude
is concerned. The practice of psychoanalysis
on others does not prevent ignorance where self is
concerned. I have analyzed dozens of psychoanalysts
and found “analytic scotoma” an appropriate
designation for their mental state. Every one is
blind about those complexes which he has not yet
conquered, whether he meets them in himself or in
others. The homosexual physician is also blind
about his own condition and should never undertake
to furnish testimony on the question whether
homosexuality is inherited or acquired.</p>

<p>There are occasions when the cover which screens
from view our inner attitude, the repressions and
transferences, the metamorphoses and changes, is
torn aside by more powerful forces and then we obtain
a view of the forces which act behind the setting
of consciousness. These occasions are the intervals
during which our inhibitions are lifted. <i>Insanity
permits us occasionally to see truths which
reason timidly keeps under cover. But alcohol also
tears aside the screen which covers the inner man.</i>
Many physicians know of persons apparently heterosexual
in every respect and who never think of homosexuality,
but who have been guilty while drunk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
carrying out homosexual deeds such as are entirely
repulsive to them in the sober state. I had
under my care a teacher who while intoxicated—the
first time in his life—attacked a boy and was guilty
of committing a crime. When he came to himself
he felt so disconsolate, his remorse was so great, that
he wanted to take his life and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that he was prevented from turning
himself over to the authorities. Later he was denounced
by some one. But I was able to squash the
inquiry for lack of positive evidence. In his favor
stood his exemplary previous life history and the
fact that he had always been an admirer of ladies
and had never taken any interest in men or boys. I
have already remarked before that a large number of
those who uphold temperance or abstinence are really
afraid of alcohol because it releases inhibitions and
permits the aggressive outbreak of repressed sensuousness.</p>

<p>I. E. Colla has reported on “<i>Three instances of
homosexual deeds during drunkenness</i>,” in the <i>Vierteljahrschrift
für gerichtliche Medizin und öffentliches
Sanitätswesen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> as follows:</p>

<p>The first case was a 29 year old inebriate who
had had a wide experience with women and carousals;
after a prolonged period of abstinence he became
intoxicated while in a sanitarium, was seduced by
a homosexual, and immediately after that, while in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
an intoxicated state, he attempted to attack a servant.
Repetition of similar episodes when under the
influence of drink but when sober exclusive breaking
forth of heterosexual feelings. A clear proof in
favor of my view about the relations of latent homosexuality
to satyriasis.</p>

<p>In the second case a controlled homosexual leaning
breaks forth overpowering the subject when
drunk. A similar picture in the third case: A protestant
minister, 37 years of age, drinker, loses his
self-control while drunk and by his offensive behavior
in a public place attracts the attention of the
authorities.</p>

<p><i>Numa Praetorius</i>, that thorough expert on homosexuality,
relates: “In many cases homosexual deeds
are committed under the influence of alcohol. Thus,
for instance, I know a former police officer, a homosexual,
who when drunk attempts homosexual deeds
upon heterosexual comrades, who excite him, although
he is acquainted with the homosexual circle,
is intimate with many homosexuals, and in his sober
state he carries out relations only with persons with
whom he is safe. On account of these attacks on
heterosexual persons during his drunken condition
he has lost his position as police officer as well as
his later position in a factory.</p>

<p>“Another homosexual, a merchant, thirty years of
age, when drunk finds this inclination uncontrollable
and has tackled the wrong persons while in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
state. There is a great deal of truth in the contention
that during the inebriate state man’s true character
comes to surface,—at any rate his true sexual
character certainly reveals itself in that state, since
the customary inhibitions are curtailed. Here ‘<i>in
vino veritas</i>’ certainly holds true.” (<i>Jahrbuch f.
Sexuelle Zwischenstufen</i>, Vol. VIII.)</p>

<p>These cases, with the exception of the first, show
only an increase of an already existing homosexual
inclination otherwise under control. But frequently
it happens that heterosexual persons carry out their
first homosexual aggression during the inebriate
state.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Praetorius</i> remarks in another passage:
“As is disclosed in various published biographies as
well as in certain communications which have reached
me orally, there are young persons, otherwise apparently
normal in feeling and conduct, who when drunk
are attracted to their own sex with a great feeling
of pleasure thus disclosing more than a pseudo-homosexual
attitude. But their proper heterosexual
nature does not appear to be changed materially by
these occasional homosexual episodes and emotional
sprees.”</p>

<p><i>Hugo Deutsch</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has reported a very instructive
case, which, although far from unique, as the author
believes, may be mentioned in this connection:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“An intelligent workingman, 39 years of age, appeals
for advice and information to the clinic for
alcoholics. As a child he suffered of rachitis and
began walking only at four years of age; excessive
masturbation as a small boy and young man; later,
occasional intercourse with girls; he married two
years ago and is the father of two children. No illness,
with the exception of minor complaints. Uses
alcohol moderately, drinks now and then one-half
to one litre of beer on the occasion of some reunion
or meeting. But this always excites his sexual passion;
specifically he feels impelled to take advantage
of young male persons<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> so as to touch and feel
their sexual parts. He has been able to withstand
this desire but once while on his way home from a
meeting where he had again taken a couple of glasses
of beer he met a young boy whom he invited to have
a drink with him and while they were sitting at a
table in the saloon he touched the boy’s genitals. A
customer saw this and denounced him to an officer
who arrested him. He was in despair over the occurrence
and only the thought of his wife and children
prevented him from committing suicide. He has not
touched a drop of alcoholic drink since because he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
recognizes how dangerous even a small amount of
drink may be for him. So long as he is sober his
libido is directed exclusively to women, in fact he feels
only <i>disgust and aversion for any homosexual deeds</i>.
When the contrary feeling first arose in connection
with drink he cannot recall. There is nothing relevant
in this connection in his family history and
there is nothing “womanly” in his physical appearance.”</p>

<p><i>Deutsch</i> believes that this is a case of bisexuality
brought to surface because the use of even moderate
doses of alcohol suspends the existing inhibitions.</p>

<p><i>Hirschfeld</i>, too, has also made a few pertinent
remarks on this subject (l. c. p. 209). He mentions
the case of a government official who attacked a
baker’s apprentice after a “heavy celebration” of
the Kaiser’s birthday; also the case of an apparently
heterosexual high school teacher who during a prolonged
carousal attacked a waiter. He also mentions
a report he was requested to make about an
officer who after a carousal requested his servant boy
to help him take an enema and used that opportunity
to seduce him. In his report <i>Hirschfeld</i> found this
complaint, if it be true, contrary to the defendant’s
whole personality, and recommended annulling the
complaint because at the time of the alleged misdeed
the accused was in a peculiar and morbid mental
state. But we must look upon these occurrences as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
proofs of man’s bisexual nature and as outbreaks
of latent homosexuality made possible through the
removal of customary inhibitions.</p>

<p><i>Otto Juliusburger</i>, in his <i>Psychology of Alcoholism</i>,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
has given us an exhaustive and masterly exposition
of this problem. That author reports that he
has been able definitely to trace the outbreak of unconscious
homosexuality in cases of dipsomania and
discusses most instructively the relations between
alcohol and homosexuality.</p>

<p><i>Juliusburger</i> describes the case of a dipsomaniac
who during the drink episodes betrayed most clearly
his homosexual love for his uncle. During those episodes
the subject felt impelled to accost men—and
only men—ordering for them anything they wished,—“frankly
a symbol, to show his affection.” “One
source of the anxiety and unrest which ushers in
the so-called dipsomaniac episode or which may
entirely replace the attack,” states <i>Juliusburger</i>, “I
see in the struggle and the resulting intrapsychic
tension between the various psychosexual components
of the individual.” I shall have occasion to
refer to <i>Juliusburger’s</i> views concerning the relationship
of the jealousy episodes of the alcoholics and
sadism in the chapter on “Jealousy.”</p>

<p>It is even more interesting in connection with our
present subject to find that homosexuals are easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
induced to carry on heterosexual deeds while under
the influence of alcohol. Of course this is not the
case in every instance but the fact is undeniable.
Neither do all heterosexuals lend themselves to homosexual
acts when drunk. Often the inhibitions are
more powerful than the releasing effect of alcohol.</p>

<p>I have made inquiries of about one hundred homosexuals
regarding the circumstances under which
they indulged in intercourse with women. Many
hesitated to answer, but I have found that a high
percentage of cases have had the experience. Some
answered saying, practically: “I can do this only if
I am under the influence of drink;” or, “while I was
drunk a girl seduced me.” We must not suppose
that homosexuals are impotent with women. There
are among them many more bisexually disposed than
are willing to recognize this fact, because they prefer
as a rule to assume the rôle of innocents before
others and for that reason they claim that intercourse
with a woman is positively impossible for
them. I have had circulated in the Viennese homosexual
circle a small questionnaire which contained
also a question covering this point. Many confessed
dislike for woman, others admitted a platonic attitude,
but there were also such answers as: “In my 34
years I have had intercourse with a woman, this I
found very pleasurable, but after four months I
turned again exclusively homosexual;” or, “now and
then I have intercourse with a woman”; further,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
“after pleasant personal relations lasting for some
time I am able to have intercourse with a woman”;
another writes: “Once I had intercourse with a
woman and it was a very pleasurable experience but
never repeated it since that time;”—Others write as
follows:</p>

<p>“Have had intercourse previously; do so no
longer.”</p>

<p>“No intercourse; presumably would be impotent
with woman.”</p>

<p>“Intercourse previously pleasurable; sudden disappearance
of feeling now makes intercourse impossible.”</p>

<p>Another writes laconically: “bisexual.”</p>

<p>At least one-fourth of my overt homosexuals are
really bisexual with subsequent modifications of their
bisexuality brought about through causes which will
be discussed in a subsequent chapter of this work.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>We now turn our attention to the next case. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
shows clearly that heterosexual tendencies arise in
the homosexual under the influence of alcohol and
it also proves that under the pressure of danger the
homosexual craving by drawing on the greater
libido turns into the heterosexual channel:</p>

<p>D. S., a clerk, 35 years of age, has been homosexual
for the past fifteen years. His father died
when he was 7 years of age. He hardly remembers
his father. His mother was always very severe, and
very energetic as well as exceedingly nervous,—she
had to go frequently to sanitaria to recuperate. He
admits having had feelings predominatingly homosexual
ever since childhood. He interested himself
only in boys and his mother brought him up in
girlish ways. He began masturbating at an early
age and already at the age of 12 he carried on
mutual pederasty with his comrades. At 17 years
of age he attempted intercourse with girls. That
was not easy, his <i>potentia</i> had to be roused by them
first through manual stimulation, then he felt some
pleasure, which was curbed partly because he could
not help thinking of the possible danger of venereal
disease, of which he had seen some illustrations in a
museum of wax figures. He was also thinking about
his mother reflecting, what would she say if she
knew what he was doing! From that time on and
until he was about 21 years of age he had intercourse
with women regularly about every month.
Then he fell in love with his office chief, who was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
extraordinarily attractive man. (He gives a romantic
description of his first ideal. This account,
of course, is not trustworthy. In fact the photo of
his latest ideal, also praised by him as an Adonis,
shows the stolid, expressionless, rather common face
of a very ordinary man, a soldier in the artillery
branch of the army).</p>

<p>His chief was a homosexual who easily seduced
him and brought him into the homosexual circle.
Then he became aware of his condition and maintained
relations only with adult and well educated
men. He had a delicate taste and not every man
could please him (here he shows me the photo of the
soldier, mentioned above). Unfortunately he had
the misfortune to be caught in a park in the act of
taking hold of the <i>membrum virile</i> of a driver. His
case is now pending in the court. He would be happy
if he could return to his former mode of gratification.
When asked if he had had no intercourse with
women during the whole period from the 22nd to the
35th year he becomes uneasy and confesses that
this has happened a few times but when he did so
he was always under the influence of drink. While
he kept sober it never happened. And every time
after intercourse with a woman he had such a terrible
after-effect that <i>his own mother to whom he always
confessed everything had advised him to seek intercourse
with men, because she noticed that he was al<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>ways
feeling fresh after doing so, while if he went
with women he was always depressed for days</i>. Experienced
psychoanalysts need not be reminded that
the mother used this means to keep her son from
contact with other women because she was jealous
of them and therefore she drove him to men. She
was never jealous of men. That was something else.</p>

<p>This occurrence is far from rare. The mother of
a homosexual once told me: “I am never jealous
when O. finds a new friend, although he falls romantically
in love with them. But the thought of his
giving himself up to a woman is something I cannot
bear....”</p>

<p>D. S. listened to his mother’s advice. He says:
“I gave up drink after that and became a fanatic
homosexual.”</p>

<p>As the subject, a high governmental employee,
could easily lose his position, I advised him to have
intercourse only with women and in view of his desire
to free himself of the trouble through psychoanalysis
I was able to wrestle him out of the clutches
of the law. He attempted contact with women, always
after partaking of small quantities of drink,
and he gradually improved so that he finally married,
his wife being, in fact, a woman 20 years older than
he. That woman was a <i>locum tenens</i> for his mother!
Further observations on the psychology of similar
cases will be recorded in subsequent pages. Here I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
propose to draw attention merely to the influence of
alcohol. Drink enabled him to adopt the heterosexual
path.</p>

<p>In the last case the heterosexual act was possible
only after neutralizing the inhibitions. Similar influences
are responsible for the well-known morning
erections of those who are psychically impotent.
Homosexuals, too, have heterosexual dreams before
awakening in the morning but they cannot—or will
not—remember those dreams. I need mention here
merely that every night the dream operates in the
sense of lifting the inhibitions and that the inhibitions
are fully suspended only towards morning.
During the first sleep hours the dreams are full of
inhibitions appearing as “warnings,” but towards
morning the dreams are relatively free of these inhibitions.
That is why we often hear that “genuine”
homosexuals are able to have intercourse with women,
if at all, only towards morning. At that time most
inhibitions which stand between them and woman
have been overcome in the dream! This obvious
fact is given a different interpretation by <i>Hirschfeld</i>
who states:</p>

<p>“The erection of the <i>membrum</i> with which many
men wake up during the early morning hours has
nothing to do with the sexual instinct, but is due
solely to the mechanical effect of pressure by the
full bladder. Some time ago I was consulted by a
homosexual, married, father of six children and ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>pecting
the arrival of a seventh. I asked him how
that was possible. ‘That is very simple,’ he answered,
not without a certain feeling of self-consciousness,
‘I always took advantage of my morning
erections.’ Thus the children owe their existence
not to the father’s sexual instinct, but to the operation
of his full bladder. The much-praised aphrodisiacs,
are probably also nothing more than diuretics;
in other words it may well be that the renown which
certain remedies and articles of diet have acquired as
stimulants of the <i>potentia coeundi</i> may well be due
to their stimulating effect upon the bladder function
and its genital reflex.</p>

<p>“Alcoholic drinks, when taken in small quantities
have a similar effect and rouse the sexual function.
Excesses <i>in Baccho</i> and venereal excesses have always
been looked upon as belonging together. This is so
because alcohol has the effect of lowering the inhibitions
and at the same time it appears to weaken the
mental acuity. We may thus see why occasionally
heterosexuals confess that they have taken up with
some man under the influence of drink, and homosexuals
that, <i>when intoxicated</i>, they can have intercourse
with women.” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>, l.c., p. 189.)</p>

<p>But the fact that homosexuals are capable of
heterosexual activity under the influence of drink
is for me a proof of their bisexuality, a proof that
that they have repressed the heterosexual component
of their sexual instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>The hypothesis that the morning erections are
due to a full bladder will be discussed more fully in
my work on <i>Male Impotence</i>. I do not believe that
erection is due to reflex action from the bladder.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<i>But it is an incontestable fact that the dream
operates until the existing psychic inhibitions are
overcome.</i> <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> patient is able to have
sexual intercourse with his wife only mornings, because
through the day and evenings he is under the
domination of inhibitions which make him impotent
with women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That the impotence in such cases does not always
denote weakness is illustrated by the following case:</p>

<p>C. H., a homosexual physician, tells me that he
abstains from touching all drinks because he fears he
might commit criminal acts. He is homosexual since
childhood and had never felt any inclination towards
women. Masturbation began at 9 years of age.
It began when his uncle once lifted him upon the
shoulder. That gave him a strong pleasurable
feeling and soon after that he began rubbing his
genitals and while doing so he always fancied that
his uncle or some other man was carrying him. He
had never felt any desire to be carried similarly by
a woman. Such a thing would strike him as degrading
and vulgar. His experience in houses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
prostitution, from 19 to 24 years of age, filled him
with disgust for all women who can be hired. Perhaps
he might have been able to have intercourse
with a girl of better class but a certain timidity prevented
him from ever approaching such a girl.
Emancipated women fill him with horror. He maintained
relations with a certain colleague for some
time. <i>Coitus inter femora.</i> At 28 years of age,
after a carousal, he met a girl whom he took to a
hotel. Powerful erection and prompt coitus. <i>But
with the onset of the orgasm he felt an overwhelming
inclination to strangle the girl.</i> Suddenly a tremendous
hatred mounted in his soul against the poor
creature. He hurried away from the scene as
rapidly as possible. He thought he wanted to revenge
himself because through the act of coitus she
degraded him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here we see a sadistic attitude towards woman
under the cover of timidity. He really feared himself,
his criminal tendencies. Problems rising out
of the struggle between the sexes (specifically, out
of man’s instinctive sex hatred of woman) play a
certain role in this case. The significance of this
attitude will be explained fully later. This case
shows the outbreak of a heterosexual-sadistic instinct
under the influence of alcoholic drink. Alcohol
seems to dissolve here the defences raised by consciousness
against the sadistic tendencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>Very interesting is the case reported by <i>Moll</i> in
his work on <i>The Contrary Sexual Feeling</i> (3rd
edition). I give here the case in brief extracts from
its history, as it contains points of significance in
connection with our present subject:</p>

<p>Miss X. is 26 years of age. Her father she describes
as a healthy but very irritable man. Already
at the age of 5 she had carried on certain sexual
plays <i>with a small boy</i>. She admits having attempted
intercourse at the time with the boy who was four
years of age. The intercourse consisted of <i>mutual
cunnilingus</i>. At six years of age she was sent to
school and here she soon began intimate relations
with small girls. With a number of them she carried
on mutual <i>cunnilingus</i> as she had done with the
boy. From the time when she first began this with
the girls her heterosexual inclination disappeared
completely; after that she never again went through
a similar experience with a boy. We shall see that
later she did allow herself to be used occasionally
by men; but we must note in that connection that the
heterosexual acts took place without the cooperation
of sexual feelings on her part. At 12 years of age
she began to menstruate. At that time she had as
playmates the children of a neighborly family who
had a governess with whom she soon entered into
close intimacy. The governess prevailed upon her
to carry on sexual acts, particularly <i>cunnilingus</i>,
and the active part was taken now by each in turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
from time to time. In the course of these relations
she experienced for the first time sexual gratification,
so far as she is able to recall. Their intimacy
lasted for some time. Miss X. differs from other
women of her type in that she is not averse to other
forms of gratification. Soon she sought also <i>anus
feminarum amatarum lambere</i>, in addition to the
genitals. The thought of carrying out such an act
with a man was repulsive to her. Just as we know
that occasionally perverse men want <i>urinam feminæ
dilectæ in os proprium immittere</i> so we see that Miss
X. likes to have the same thing done to her by other
girls. For a number of years already Miss X. has
been in the habit of allowing <i>fæces amicæ in os
proprium iniciire</i>; the act produces in her gratification
and orgasm. She had first indulged in these
acts during her intercourse with the governess above
mentioned, which lasted several years. Miss X. is
also tremendously roused when she <i>sanguinem menstruationis
amicæ lambit et devorat</i>; but, she explains
that she is able to carry out these disgusting
acts only when there is complete mutual confidence
and only if the relationship has endured for some
time. She declares further that she is sexually
roused also when she is struck with a whip. When
asked how she came to acquire this habit she answered
that she knew a man who required to be thus
treated by a former sweetheart. But, to secure her
any sexual excitement the whiplashes must fall upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
her from the hands of a woman. She has allowed
herself very often to be flagellated by her friend
with whom she has also been carrying on the disgusting
acts mentioned above. It may be mentioned
also that when they kiss each other Miss X. wants
to be bitten by her friend, preferably upon the ear
lobe. This may be carried so far as to actually
cause pain and swelling of the ear.</p>

<p>It is necessary to delineate more clearly the attitude
of Miss X. towards the male sex. She does not
remember having ever felt any attraction towards
the male. But during a celebration where much
drinking was had a man prevailed upon her to spend
the night with him. She had always wondered why
she never felt any attraction towards the male sex
and the desire to find out definitely about this as
well as the don’t-care-attitude brought on by drink
induced her to spend that night with the man.
Coitus brought her no satisfaction. Some time
later another man became interested in her and fell
in love with her but she did not reciprocate his
feeling in the least. Nevertheless she wanted to try
once more whether she could learn to care for a man’s
embrace. She therefore permitted herself to be induced
by that man to have intercourse a few times;
again she found that ordinary coitus did not rouse
the least sexual feeling in her. She requested the
man to carry on <i>cunnilingus</i> with her. This roused
her sexually and thereupon she experienced gratifi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>cation;
but, without being asked specifically about
it, she declares at the same time, that it was necessary
for her to imagine that the person performing <i>cunnilingus</i>
on her was a woman; otherwise even <i>cunnilingus</i>
would have yielded her no satisfaction. The
thought of carrying on any of the disgusting acts
mentioned above with a man, Miss X. found in the
highest degree repulsive. (<i>Moll</i>, l.c, p. 565.)</p>

<p>This case appears to me very noteworthy. It
supports my contentions regarding the influence of
alcohol upon the homosexual. Miss X. beclouds the
fact and thinks she was actuated by the desire to
find out definitely whether man had any attraction
for her. Absence of orgasm during her intercourse
with the first man shows clearly that even indulgence
in alcohol was unable that time to release the inhibitions.
But she allows herself the experience a
second time and this time <i>cunnilingus</i> by the man
yields her gratification. It is interesting that her
first experience of this kind was with a boy. This
corresponds exactly with my observations. In other
ways, too, man plays in her condition a greater role
than she is willing to recognize. Flagellation she
adopts because she knew a man who was treated that
way by his previous sweetheart. The relationship
of this paraphilia to the strong, irritable father is
fairly obvious. Her misophilic acts with women
show that <i>she does not want to belittle herself before
man, but that she looks upon subjecting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>self
to woman as a manner of paying homage to her
sex.</i> In my study on <i>Masochism</i> I go further into
this subject. The other acts indicate a sexual infantilism,
rarely seen in a more discreet polymorph-perverse form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Fleischmann</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> also records a few cases showing
homosexual seduction carried out during a state of
intoxication. He relates also the case of a homosexual
who when intoxicated was able to have intercourse
with women. “At 28 years of age,” relates
the author about this subject, “he visited a
house of prostitution for the first time and, animated
by drink, he was able to carry out coitus once
with a woman; when sober a twenty-horse team could
not drag him into such a place,” according to the
urning. But after drinking he was always able to
have coitus.</p>

<p>We see that the incentive to drink is obviously
due to an ungratified craving. Psychoanalytic experience
reiterates again and again that almost
every craving to become drunk or otherwise to lose
one’s senses betrays an ungratified sexuality.
Among the inebriates, the morphine and cocaine addicts,
we always find pronounced paraphiliacs and
bisexuals who have repressed a portion of their sex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>ual
instinct. In the same way every unprejudiced
investigator will find a similar condition true of
homosexuals who, according to my experience, are
bisexuals who have repressed the heterosexual component
of their instinct. I cannot agree with
<i>Naecke</i>,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who contends that urning as such is a
moderate drinker and seldom inebriate. Nor do I
believe that in homosexual circles moderation in
drink is the rule. Of course, I do know a number of
temperate homosexuals, but the data under my observation
as a whole and the material supplied
through the objective accounts of physicians, reveal
an entirely different situation.</p>

<p>A great deal of what takes place during states of
intoxication never comes to the attention of those
not immediately concerned. Possibly infantile experiences
with drunken parents may have a greater
role in the psychogenesis of homosexuality than we
are aware of at the present time.</p>

<p>Now and then it happens that parents, drunken
or otherwise debauched, attack their own children.
I have had occasion to observe that some very curious
habits are still prevalent in the nursery, here and
there. One subject related to me that his mother
had the habit of playing with his penis until he was
six years of age. His wife also found this a con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>venient
way to lull their child to sleep. He thought
it was as harmless a practice as it seemed efficacious
in quieting the child.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>H. T., a homosexual chemist by profession, who
has a theoretic interest in psychoanalysis, writes
me: “The contribution that I am able to make may
be of some use to you. I have often tried to think
whether dreams have had any influence upon the
development of my sexual life. But I could recall
no experience which I could correlate to my condition.
I have felt early an interest in the <i>membrum
virile</i> and this interest abides with me to this day.
The sight of the penis in a state of erection is
enough to rouse in me the strongest feelings of
pleasure. While walking on the street I always try
to observe the respective region in passers-by and I
try to estimate the size of the organ by outward appearances,—my
fancies are full of such reflections.
I have always masturbated in front of the mirror
watching my penis during the act. But it took a
very long time for me to overcome my shyness enough
to find companions for these acts.</p>

<p>A few days ago I had a dream in which I saw
my father who has been dead for ten years. He
was the best man in the world, but unfortunately a
periodic drinker. When in the inebriate state he
treated mother very roughly. I dreamed a scene
which scared me so that I awoke. I saw my father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
give me in hand his <i>membrum erectum</i>. And suddenly
there flashed through my mind the recollection
that he had done repeatedly this very thing when
he was drunk. But with every fibre of my being I
cling to my mother who is for me the ideal of womanhood
such as I shall never again find the equal of
in all this world! Beyond that my love is directed
only to the male and specifically I am attracted to
common men. Can you explain my riddle? I feel
myself attracted to ordinary drivers, men of vulgar
tastes such as one finds in the dram shops. Only
once was I able to have intercourse with a girl. I
was so “soused” at the time that I then did something
which I could never carry out while in my
ordinary senses....”</p>

<p>I emphasize once more: The outbreak of heterosexual
excitations after indulgence in alcohol proves
the presence of that tendency and shows that under
ordinary conditions the heterosexual tendency,
though continually present, is subjected to suppression.
The tendency is preserved in some closed-in
compartment of the soul, the door to which may
gape open under certain circumstances. Occasionally
alcohol acts as a master key which opens up
every enclosure.</p>

<p>It is interesting also to observe the sublimation
which the heterosexual love undergoes among homosexuals.
They endeavor to de-sexualize the other
sex, at the same time have recourse to heterosexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
friendships by preference. I know quite a number
of homosexuals of this class, men who maintain
motherly, sisterly, or even grandmotherly friendships
and to whom these friendships are positively
indispensable. We psychoanalysts are in a position
to appreciate the source of these sexual attachments.
They are due to repression and are also the result
of an inhibition which extends merely over sexuality
but allows the <i>sublimated</i> eroticism to manifest itself.
Among the homosexuals there are many women
haters (misogynists).</p>

<p>They often hate all women with but one exception:
their mother. Occasionally some sister, aunt, or
some friend of their mother’s is also exempted. They
never fail to emphasize: this is an exception! But
the law of bipolarity teaches us that alongside this
tremendous hatred there exists an equally powerful
love. Occasionally the dislike is hidden and the
homosexuals pose as completely indifferent towards
the other sex. A little close analysis shows that this
attitude is an artefact, that the assumed indifference
really covers the fear that the true attitude will be
betrayed otherwise. Beyond the apparent indifference
stands the fear of woman and back of that
fear there may be hidden, in its turn, a sadistic
attitude towards woman. It is thus that the homosexual
learns to cover his feelings with one another,
to change them, or else he transforms, substitutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
overstresses here and assumes indifference there, until
his actual state of feelings is completely hidden from
view. Superficial observers merely remark of some
man: he hates women!...</p>

<p>What stands back of such a dislike has been
pointed out by <i>Bloch</i> (l.c.) with considerable insight.
He mentions the famous misogynist of
Classical Greece, Euripides, and in that connection
makes a very appropriate observation. He states:</p>

<p>“The strongest invectives against the female sex
are found in <i>Ion</i>, <i>Hippolytos</i>, <i>Hekate</i>, and <i>Kyklops</i>
of <i>Euripides</i>. (<i>Verses</i> 602-637, 650-655.) (Here
he introduces the actual quotation.)</p>

<p>“These verses contain the whole quintessence of
modern misogyny. But <i>Euripides</i> also discloses the
ultimate background for this attitude: ‘The most
wanton creature,’ he says in a fragment, ‘is woman.’
<i>Hinc illæ lacrimæ!</i> Only men who are not accustomed
to woman, men who cannot endure to have
her act with them as a free personality, and who are
so little certain of themselves that they fear an inroad
into their own personality, some irreparable
damage or possibly complete annihilation, only such
men are genuine women haters.” (<i>Bloch</i>, l.c., p.
533.)</p>

<p>Here <i>Bloch</i> has come close to a solution of the
problem having plainly adopted the view developed
later by <i>Adler</i>, who traces homosexuality to the fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
of the sexual partner. Unfortunately he has failed
to draw the further inferences which this excellent
observation is capable of yielding.</p>

<p><i>Hate, fear, disgust and shame are the inhibitions
which keep the homosexual away from the sexual
partner.</i></p>

<p>Let us examine first the feeling of disgust. How
does the feeling arise? In my study of <i>Anxiety
States</i> I have explained this matter more fully. But
there is a form of disgust whose action is positive.
Disgust need not always be necessarily repressed desire.
If I should see today a woman covered all over
with furuncles it may inspire me with disgust to hear
that she is an old aunt whom I must greet with a
kiss. In a case of this kind only the super-analyst
in his folly might be able to discover suppressed
components of the libido.</p>

<p>But we do know that occasionally homosexuality
may be aroused through episodes which enlist the
negative reactions (hate, fear, disgust, shame).
These revulsive effects then protect the individual
against their own positive tendencies. Disgust
covers craving, hate covers love, fear covers longing;
and shame—boldness.</p>

<p>But indulgence in alcohol is capable of turning
revulsive effects into positive. Disgust is turned
into desire, hate into love, fear into longing and
shame turns into daring. If the fearful, repressed
sadism is also added to this transformation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
negative into positive affects, when it cannot be
sublimated into lasting love, the moral man is
turned into a criminal who represents but a stage
in the development of the human race.</p>

<p>The form of homosexuality which develops late
in life is perhaps best suited to serve as an introduction
to our inquiry into the psychogenesis of
homosexuality and may help us understand the
origin of the more complicated cases.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, a number of cases, in which
homosexuality appears to have developed in consequence
of a feeling of dislike for the other sex.
Many authors consider the development of homosexuality
among prostitutes as due to this cause.
<i>Bloch</i>, for instance, writes:</p>

<p>“The naturally heterosexual prostitutes are
driven to homosexuality for one of two reasons:
First through the contact with and the influence of
their truly Lesbian comrades, which strengthens the
inner feeling of solidarity common among all prostitutes;
Second, through their dislike of intercourse
with men which grows with their experience and with
the passage of time, the more so because they see
man only in his brutal and raw aspect. The continual
compulsion under which they find themselves
of satisfying the animal sensuousness of oversophisticated
men often by means of disgusting procedures,
rouses in them eventually an unconquerable
dislike of the male sex, and therefore they devote to
their own sex the nobler feelings of which they may
be capable. The homosexual relationship appears to
them as something ‘higher, something nobler and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
more innocent,’ something pertaining to a purer
realm than sexual contact with men, a fact which
<i>Eulenburg</i> (<i>Sexuelle Neuropathie</i>, p. 143-144) has
rightly observed.” (<i>Bloch</i>, l.c., p. 603.)</p>

<p><i>Krafft-Ebing</i> (<i>Neue Studien</i>, l.c.) also holds this
view and thinks that, “many prostitutes endowed
with great sensuousness, repelled by contact with
perverse or impotent men who misuse them in connection
with detestable sexual deeds, turn to pleasing
members of their own sex.”</p>

<p>In connection with my discussion of the Messalina
type I have already shown that latent homosexuality
is what drives many women to prostitution. They
run away from woman and into the arms of man,
into the arms of a great number of men! They expect
quantity to replace what quality fails to supply
them. We have additional reasons to assume that
the women who lean most strongly towards the homosexual
side are those who supply the ranks of prostitutes.
That of course is true of the largest number
though by no means holding true of every case.
For there are prostitutes who are attached to their
lover (cadet), and who experience orgasm only during
intercourse with him, while the embraces of other
men leave them unaffected. Here and there the
factors pointed out by <i>Bloch</i> and <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> may
also enter into the situation. In the presence of an
already avowed homosexual inclination disgust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
brought about through a number of possible circumstances
may act as an effective barrier against heterosexuality.</p>

<p>This is revealed to us through the life histories
of certain homosexuals. We often come across the
statement that certain men, and women too, became
homosexual after an infection, particularly gonorrhea.
The fear of infection also plays an important
role in the psychogenesis of homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><i>Krafft-Ebing</i> mentions (<i>Late Homosexuality</i>,
etc.) the case of a young man, 27 years of age, who
after masturbating since 7 years of age, at 19 years
had intercourse with women and enjoyed it. After
a gonorrheal infection he became so disgusted with
women that when frequenting houses of prostitution
he found himself impotent. Old masochistic-homosexual
phantasies reappeared and before long he was
attracted to the respective circle and seduced.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
must draw attention particularly to the fact that
this man was able to experience orgasm during intercourse
with women. Nevertheless his experience
was so impressive that it intensified his revulsive attitude
towards heterosexuality by generating a feeling of
disgust. (In other cases under similar circumstances
there arises a dislike for prostitutes, and
the subject seeks as sexual partner a healthy
woman.) The infection often becomes the root of
a phantastic hatred of women without leading all
the way to the development of a manifest homosexuality.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The next case which has come under my
own observation belongs to this category:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I. P., engineer, 30 years of age, appears to me a
typical anxiety neurotic. He is unable to leave his
room, a personal servant must accompany him
wherever he goes. For the past ten years has been
sexually abstinent, because he had the misfortune to
acquire a very serious luetic infection from a so-called
“respectable” woman. Since that experience
he feels a tremendous hatred for the sex. He reads
with interest <i>Strindberg</i>, gloats over <i>Weininger</i> and
he has translated into a foreign language <i>Moebius’</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
“<i>Der physiologische Schwachsinn des Weibes.</i>”
Homosexual activity does not inspire him with disgust
but he claims that it has no attraction for him.
Analysis discloses that the anxiety attacks appear
as a defence against homosexual deeds. After the
syphilitic infection he was for a time in danger of
becoming homosexual. Now he protects himself
against that tendency by various defensive measures.
The path to woman is effectively blocked for him
through his disgust and hatred of the sex.</p>

<p>The cure of his anxiety state was not very difficult.
A few years later I found him a married man.
He had married a woman who was 10 years older
than he and who lacked every womanly characteristic.
He is entirely potent in his marital relations,
claims to experience orgasm satisfactorily, and believes
his orgasm would be even greater if he did not
have to use precautionary measures against pregnancy.
As a syphilitic he wants to avoid bringing
sickly children into the world. For coitus he prefers
the <i>a posteriori</i> position and <i>situs inversus</i> and justifies
this theoretically on the basis of the structure of
the female genitalia....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concerning the relationship between sexual infection
and homosexuality we also have an illuminating
observation by <i>Fleischmann</i>.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This case is
an <i>urlind</i> (homosexual woman):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>She is an illegitimate child. Father a heavy
drinker. She was badly brought up, neglected and
persecuted. As a child she avoided work and was
unruly. Prison experience. “At 16 years of age
I had to earn my own living. My first position was
in a restaurant serving beer. There I met Mr. X.,
the man who seduced me and gave me a sexual
disease.</p>

<p>“At the hospital I saw and heard things that
opened my eyes. From that time on I worked no
longer. Years passed in struggle with suffering and
want; prison life; house of correction; solitary confinement.
In the house of correction most girls
handled one another at night and from that time on
no man could interest me any more. I have intercourse
only with girls who are pretty. For the past
year I have been a prostitute,—mostly drunk,—for I
wanted to forget what has become of me and the
morbid inclination to which I have fallen a victim.”</p>

<p>The first sexual experience of the poor girl an infection!
Then followed the homosexual seduction
and the heterosexual channel was blocked. We see
here the characteristic homosexuality of the prostitute,
already mentioned; then alcoholism, obviously
to forget her longing after true love. It must be
clear also that her hatred of the father played a
certain role and that this feeling towards the drunkard
who brought her into the world a bastard she
transferred towards all men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>The two cases reported by <i>Ziemke</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> are also fairly
clear:</p>

<p>An artist; between the age of 16 and 17 years a
relative taught him to masturbate and he kept up
the practice regularly every week. At 18 years of
age first intercourse with woman; acquired gonorrhea;
later, once more coitus, this time with a prostitute;
never took any particular interest in the female
sex; on the other hand as a boy 9 years of age
he already was pleased at the sight of the <i>membrum
virile</i> so much that it brought on erection. First
sexual dreams were definitely of homosexual import,
according to his own declaration, and continued of
that character. Later has had repeated sexual experiences
with other men, always feels fresh and well
after that, while normal sexual intercourse fills him
with disgust. His sexual partner he seeks among
men of middle age; he is familiar with the literature
on homosexuality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another case: Former officer, 38 years of age,
mother said to have been a very nervous woman.
Very shy and bashful as a child in the presence of
older persons or strangers. At high school had to
repeat the same class twice, was coached and succeeded
at last to pass the army examination for
officer. After a few years was dismissed from the
army because he had mishandled his man-servant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
went to South-West Africa, there settled as a
farmer, and as a volunteer participated in several
small riots.</p>

<p>His first sexual feelings arose around the 12th
year; he contends that till that time he knew absolutely
nothing about sexual matters. At that age
an experience brought his attention to the subject
of sex for the first time; he played circus with a
younger sister and with his 10-year old uncle and
sat on the latter’s back. While imitating a rider’s
movements he noticed that his penis became stiff and
he had a pleasurable sensation wetting himself in
front. He did not know the meaning of this occurrence
but was too shy to tell anyone about it.
Shortly after that he tried deliberately to reproduce
similar situations; whenever he succeeded he also
tried to attain ejaculation. He insists that he was
not attracted particularly to his uncle, whom alone
he had used for this form of gratification, nor to any
other boy or man, his only desire at the time was to
achieve ejaculation. Later during his high school
years, when he had opportunity to gratify himself
in the same way, he met a young colleague of his own
age, a strong and beautiful boy, who appealed to
him very strongly and with that boy playing the
passive role he indulged more and more frequently in
sexual deeds. In fact as soon as he met that particular
boy the thought occurred to him that he
would like to have him for the gratification of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
sexual feelings in the manner peculiar to himself.
During play he used all manner of excuses to climb
upon his friend’s back and to imitate a rider’s galloping
movements until he had ejaculation. Subsequently
he found frequent occasion to use other colleagues
in the same way. After drinking it was
particularly difficult for him to restrain himself;
that is why he frequently had to do with soldiers
while intoxicated and one day he was caught and
this led to his dismissal from the army. In order to
get rid of his unnatural inclination he took up a girl,
had normal intercourse with her a few times but
without any pleasurable feeling on his part, although
in order to accomplish this he had to suppose himself
riding a man in the manner customary with him, and
eventually he acquired a gonorrheal infection. Then
he migrated to South-West Africa, but even there
was unable to master his inclination, felt himself impelled
to maintain relations with young Hottentots,
was caught at it, sentenced to jail, and finally banished
from the Country.</p>

<p>In this case the gonorrheal infection seems to
have put an end to his heterosexual period.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I recall a number of other cases in which homosexuality
broke out after gonorrhea, according to
the testimony obtained during my consultation
hours. In fact, there was a time when I was a firm
believer in the theory of inherited homosexuality, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
<i>Hirschfeld’s</i> sense, so that I turned down all these
cases and did not care to undertake a psychoanalysis
of them. In the homosexual circles I had
quite a reputation at the time as a man worthy of
their confidence. But since I have found that homosexuals
are really bisexual neurotics who have repressed
their heterosexuality, these men come to me
more rarely and consult me chiefly when they get into
conflict with the law. The solidarity of homosexuals
and their will to hold on to the notion that
their condition is inborn goes hand in hand. Their
secret organisation is thorough, and even where
formal organisations are lacking, homosexuals know
each other and they are always ready to introduce
to one another their friends and colleagues.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dr. S. K., physician, 32 years of age, relates that
he has a pronounced heterosexual past. At any
rate his longing previously was purely physical and
psychically he was completely indifferent. As ship
surgeon he acquired a severe gonorrhea in a port
and this trouble lasted some six months. He suffered
all possible complications: epididymitis, a posterior
prostatitis and finally, a gonorrheal rheumatism
of the joints. Since that trouble he has felt
a terrific disgust for women. In Alexandria while
entering a cabin he saw one of the ship lieutenants
committing pederasty with a local boy. He knew
that at the various ports young boys visited the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
ships and offered themselves to the homosexual officers.
The scene evoked in him a terrific nausea and
he wanted to drop that officer from among his acquaintances.
But the latter spoke up frankly confessing
that he became homosexual after being seduced
and since then he was completely impotent in
the company of a woman. He begged the physician
to keep his secret and not to betray him. He was
the only intellectual man on board that ship with
whom it was pleasant to have relations. In a few
weeks the two men became intimate with each other:
“Then, for the first time, I learned what love was and
I had never before been as happy as that. My
heterosexual past now seemed unbelievable. But
in <i>Platen’s</i> diary I came across a passage telling
that as a young man he too had been in love with a
girl named Euphrasia and that he learned only later
the true direction of his sexual instinct. It was the
same with me. I was born a homosexual although I
had to go through some experiences before my eyes
opened.”</p>

<p>In this case the gonorrheal infection and the
trivial incident during the journey through the
Orient furnished the occasion for the outbreak of
homosexuality. But is not the subject in error regarding
the strength of his homosexual predisposition?
It is interesting to note that his homosexual
attitude is promptly beatified and idealized through
the addition of psychic factors. Indeed, the homo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>sexuals
display a greater love intoxication than
the heterosexuals. Such a degree of love frenzy as
is displayed by the homosexuals is hardly ever seen
among the heterosexuals. Homosexuality represents
a harbor of refuge, an attempt to lose one’s
self exclusively in one direction, which must be conceived
as an attempt on the part of the psyche to
neutralize all other tendencies by the overemphasis
of that supreme passion.</p>

<p>We find frequently that the homosexuals contend
that their previous heterosexual leanings were exclusively
physical.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Psychically their love relations
must be exclusively homosexual. In fact it is common
to find men sublimating into friendship their
craving for psychic love while woman remains with
them merely an instrument for sin (<i>instrumentum
diaboli</i>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain homosexual whose history is of particular
interest because he recalls clearly his heterosexual
period told <i>Bloch</i>:</p>

<p>“At what age my sexual feelings first arose I am
unable to recall. My sexual desires are directed
towards the male. <i>Before and during my puberty
the actual direction of my desire was not clear, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
fact I believe I did entertain at the time a wish to
have once intercourse with a girl.</i> But it was not
love, what I felt was merely a physical longing,—the
psychic counterpart of the instinct was entirely
absent at the time. Now I feel myself inclined exclusively
towards young boys. I have had no intercourse
thus far either with males or females, but
I believe I would be able to carry out the sexual act
in a normal way; I know, however, that it would not
be pleasurable to me, it would not amount to more
than masturbation so far as I am concerned. Towards
the female sex I am completely indifferent, I
feel neither disgust nor any dislike. My love dreams
are always concerned with persons of my own sex.”
(<i>Bloch</i>, l.c., p. 566.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Homosexuality often develops also in women following
an infection:</p>

<p>Miss Erna, 42 years of age, writer, shows preeminent
male features, behaves peculiarly like a male,
smokes, drinks, is a preeminent champion of
women’s rights. She claims to be innately homosexual,
even as a child she assumed a male role, and
was wilder than her brothers. She always passed
for an uncontrollable tomboy. Had no intimation
about her homosexual condition. Masturbated
very early and already at the age of 15 she maintained
clandestine relations with an army officer
who had seduced her. But she claims that her ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>perience
was exclusively physical. She has experienced
orgasm with men. At 19 years of age another
army officer gave her a venereal disease. <i>Since that
time she feels a tremendous dislike for all men.</i> At
22 years of age she conceived a romantic love for a
woman friend. They kept up a relationship during
which she maintained the male role. She even procured
for herself an artificial phallus and wore male
clothes in the house. It was like a genuine marriage.
“I know only since then what love really means.
Formerly I only felt a liking for men. It was
merely a physical attraction. But for the past 20
years my love has been exclusively for women.”
After the first “homosexual marriage,” which lasted
only three years because her friend deserted her and
married, she had numerous relations with other
women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very convincing are the cases in which the homosexual
outbreak occurs first after some powerful
trauma! It is not always gonorrhea. Often
various other experiences furnish the inciting moment
as I can easily prove on the basis of my own
observations. But first I must quote a case reported
by <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> which is illuminating on
this score:</p>

<p>Miss X., 22 years of age, is considered a beauty,
men flock around her whenever she appears in
society; she is decidedly of a sensuous nature, seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
born to be an <i>Aspasia</i>, but rejects all advances.
One of her admirers, however, a young scientist, she
looks upon with some favor, becomes intimate with
him, allows herself to be kissed by him, <i>but not like
a loving woman</i>; and when the young man believes
himself close to the consummation of his supreme
desire she begs him with tears in her eyes to desist
because she is utterly unable to yield to him, not
on account of moral grounds so much as for deeper
psychic reasons. In the course of the exchange of
written confidences which followed that unsuccessful
meeting between the two the homosexual character of
her inclination was clearly revealed to her.</p>

<p>Miss X. had a father who was addicted to drink
and a hysteropathic mother. She herself is of a
neuropathic constitution; has full breasts, and generally
the outward appearance of an unusually attractive
woman but reveals boyish ways about her
and various male peculiarities,—she fences, rides
horseback, smokes and has a decidedly mannish way
of standing and walking. Lately her romantic attachment
to young women has become quite noticeable.
She has a young woman with her sharing her
apartment.</p>

<p>Miss X. claims that up to the time of puberty she
was sexually indifferent. At 17 years of age she
became acquainted at a summer resort with a young
foreigner whose “majestic” figure made a tremendous
impression upon her. The privilege of danc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>ing
a whole evening with him made her happy. <i>The
following evening, at twilight, she witnessed a horrible
scene—from her window she saw that wonderful
man in the bushes futuare more bestiarum mulierem
quandam inter menstruationem.</i></p>

<p><i>Adspectu sanguinis currentis et libidinis quasi
bestialis viri Miss X. felt shocked, she seemed powerless
and crushed, could hardly recover her psychic
equilibrium and for some time after that could
neither sleep nor eat; from that time on man stood in
her mind for the quintessence of bestiality.</i></p>

<p>Two years later a young woman approached her
in a public garden, smiled and glanced at her with a
very peculiar look which penetrated deeply into her
soul. The following day Miss X. felt impelled to
visit again that public garden. The woman was
there, in fact, she seemed to have been expecting her.
They greeted one another like old acquaintances;
they talked and joked pleasantly and thereafter met
by appointment daily, first in the garden, and later,
when the weather became unpleasant, in the woman’s
living apartment. “One day,” Miss X. relates confidentially
“the woman led me up to her divan and
allowed me to glide to the floor while she seated herself.
She lifted her shy eyes at me, stroked the hair
off my forehead softly with her hand, saying: ‘Oh,
if I could once love you the real way, may I?’ I
consented, and as we sat close by gazing into each
other’s eyes, before we knew it we passed to that love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
from which there is no drawing back.... She was
bewitchingly beautiful. For me the whole experience
was something new and intoxicating.... I
do not believe that man is ever able to feel such delicate,
bewitching, exquisite intoxication.... Man
is not sufficiently sensitive, he is not delicate enough
for that.... Our foolish abandon lasted until I fell
back exhausted, helpless, intoxicated. In this exhausted
state I was lying on her bed when suddenly
an exquisite feeling thrilled through me and awoke
me from my half dreamy state, something unspeakably
sweet and unlike anything I had ever experienced
before; I found J. on top of me, <i>cunnilingus
perficiens</i>—that was her highest pleasure, <i>tandem
mihi non licebat altrum quam osculos dare ad mammas</i>—and
with every motion she shook convulsively.”</p>

<p>Miss X. acknowledged further that during her
homosexual relations she always assumed the male
attitude towards her womanly companion and that
once, <i>faute de mieux</i>, she allowed one of her male
admirers to perform <i>cunnilingus</i> on her.
(<i>Krafft-Ebing</i>, l.c., Obs. 165.)</p>

<p>Let us consider closely the case of an exalted
nature like that girl. She goes through her first
graceful love fever, she is about to become a true
woman, she thinks “him” a princely man, a “majestic”
personality when unexpectedly she undergoes
the experience of witnessing that very God-like man
behave like a common beast.... Jealousy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
a revulsion of feeling unite in her at the terrible
sight rousing such a tremendous affect that forever
after she feels an unspeakable horror of all men.</p>

<p>Many women must have become <i>urlinds</i> as a result
of just such experiences. One must also take
into account that among many women homosexual
love shows itself merely in kisses and embraces and
that it seems to them something nobler and much
more esthetic than the manifestations of heterosexual
love. Fear of the phallus is something that may
be roused by a relatively slight infantile occurrence.
In her homosexual indulgences Miss X. is not particularly
esthetic by any means, nevertheless even
she remarks: “man is not delicate enough!”</p>

<p>This highly interesting case illustrates the development
of homosexuality following a trauma
which must have had a tremendous effect upon so
sensitive and romantic a nature as this young
woman and which could not but strengthen the existing
predisposition to homosexuality. But in spite
of all she is still bisexual and I do not think it impossible
that she should yet overcome her tremendous
horror of man. We must consider that the
father was a drinker and that she had probably witnessed
in the parental home scenes like the one she
has described. What a pity that the case has not
been analyzed. <i>Traumatic incidents during later
life are particularly powerful in their effect if they
resemble and therefore re-echo infantile memories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
of similar childhood experiences.</i> It may even be
possible that the woman did not actually witness the
scene at the time she states but that she experienced
merely a hallucination, repeating in her mind a scene
which she may have witnessed only during her childhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A remarkable parallel is furnished by the next
case which I record from among my own observations:</p>

<p>Miss K. S. is 32 years of age and calls to consult
me about her various compulsions. She confesses
that she is an <i>urlind</i> and that she had never felt herself
attracted to men. Her father, a heavy drinker,
died three years ago; her mother lives quietly and
is not neurotic.</p>

<p>Our subject has had a number of chances to get
married but she withdraws coyly from every man
the moment one comes close to her. She feels a certain
inclination towards older married men and she
understands in consequence how a woman might become
interested in a friend’s husband. “When I did
find a man whom I liked, I was unlucky,” she declares,
“for I discovered that he was already engaged
to a friend of mine.” Truly she fell in love
only with girls and women. Her first romantic attachment
was to a woman school teacher, whom she
also visited at her home. That teacher wanted this
wealthy girl to marry her brother and brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
two into contact as often as possible. She liked the
brother because he looked so very much like her beloved
friend. But if the sister was not in the room
their conversation lagged and she could talk only in
monosyllables. She sent flowers and costly gifts to
her teacher. Her supreme desire was to sleep once in
the same bed with that teacher and she often dreamed
of it. She even proposed to take her on a journey.
The teacher could not go and hesitated also because
she found her pupil’s attentions too oppressive.
The teacher actually suffered on account of her admirer’s
deep jealousy, for the girl turned ill if she
so much as found other girls visiting her. At any
rate, quite a circle of girls in the class admired the
teacher.</p>

<p>Later she fell in love with a girl friend whom she
embraced and kissed warmly numberless times because
it gave her a wonderful warm feeling to do so.
On the other hand the kisses of an uncle made no
impression on her whatever. No man interested
her in the least. For a long time she did not know
that she was homosexual, but she was well aware
since her childhood that she was unlike other children.
She was always as wild as a boy and her
mother frequently said to her: “there are ten rough
boys in you!” She climbed trees, ran around wildly
and always preferred to play with boys, did not care
for dolls, coaxed to be given a saddle horse and a gun
until her father was driven to despair over her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
exclaimed sometimes: “you are really a spoiled boy!”</p>

<p>During the analysis she recalled a number of
homosexual and heterosexual experiences. Already
at 12 years of age she had an experience with an
uncle who came to her in bed and played with her.
She could not recall whether they indulged in coitus
that time. With girl friends she also had various
adventures. She confesses in fact that she has been
in the habit of masturbating since her 12th year,
when she was taught by a girl, and that at one time
she often indulged in the phantasy that a man was
having coitus with her. In fact, as late as her 16th
year she fell “heels-over-head” in love with a friend
of her father’s. He was much younger than her
father but belonged to the same circle.</p>

<p>While she talks at first only in favorable terms
about her father (his drinking habit was not so very
excessive) and dwells mostly on his lovely qualities,
his mild character, his imposing appearance, etc., at
the same time she begins to show underneath a growing
hatred. The father had in fact left her in
critical circumstances. Every one considered them
millionaires, because her father had kept up a very
big house. After his death it turned out that he
had been spending his capital and that there had
been left practically only her share which was,
however, large enough to permit her and her mother
to live in comfort. Her mother had always endured
the life of a martyr. The father had main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>tained
relations with the cook in the house during
the last ten years. She was a fat, shapeless vulgar
person. In fact, mother and daughter were just
tolerated in their home. Once her mother endeavored
to dismiss the cook and the father was mad
and grew almost violent showing her mother the door
threatening that she might leave and take along her
daughter if she did not like it in the house. After
that the cook was naturally more arrogant and unbearable
than ever so that the poor mother passed
her days weeping until finally she reconciled herself
to that state of things. It was possible to throw
that cook out of the house only after her father
was lying ill in bed. That daring woman started a
law suit claiming that the father had promised to
settle on her a home and an income.... She lost that
suit because the father testified upon his death-bed
that the woman’s contentions were false. The subject
relates a number of other relevant incidents but
does not recall having ever witnessed any intimacies
between her father and the cook.</p>

<p>However, her dreams seem to point in that sense.
Thus, for instance, among others she had the following
dream:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>I go carefully into the kitchen and do not find
the cook there. Then I tiptoe slowly up the back
stairs to the garret and through the key hole I see
the cook lying in bed with the driver.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>She recalls that that particular driver was in their
service when the cook was a younger woman and that
her father had dismissed him. He watched for her
father once, as he was coming out of a restaurant to
waylay him. But her father was stronger and threw
the servant to the ground with such force that the
fellow fractured a bone. But she thinks that the
neighborhood did not know the true reason for the
battle, every one naturally thinking that the servant
planned the attack out of revenge.</p>

<p>Finally she confessed to me that there was one experience
of which she had not thought before for a
long time which she must tell me about. She wanted
to tell me about it for some time but an inexplicable
shyness prevented her. She was 16 years of age
when she once heard her father leaving his study
room to steal upstairs to the garret. It was the
maid’s day out and her mother was lying down not
feeling well. She took her shoes off and followed
him quietly up the stairs. The door to the servants’
room stood open. The father was somewhat
under the influence of drink and so was also the
cook, who always managed to secure some liquor
for herself on the sly. A candle was burning in the
room and the stairway was dark. She could see
plainly everything that was going on. She now saw
<i>pater membrum suum in os ancillæ immisit</i>.
The sight of his reddish face now distorted under the
influence of passion was so repulsive to her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
struck her so powerfully that she could never forget
it in her life. Even to this day when she thinks of
it she feels nauseated. (While she is telling the incident
she is struggling against the impulse to vomit.)
After that episode she developed a nervous complaint
of the stomach, chiefly a nervous vomiting.
Even during the year just passed there were times
when she could not swallow a morsel of meat and she
had attacks of uncontrollable vomiting.</p>

<p>It was after that occurrence that she fell in love
with her teacher. That episode was what had determined
the course of her sexual development and
what drove her to homosexuality because it made
her look at all men in the light in which she had seen
her father. Her inclination towards elderly married
men (always platonic) is also traceable to her
father <i>Imago</i>. She was aiming to find a nobler and
more delicate father.</p>

<p>Whenever a man tried to get closer to her it reminded
her of the painful incident she had witnessed,
which summed up in her mind all the misery in her
home, the whole outrageous situation, the humiliation
of her mother, and her father’s morbid passion.
For her father who did have some splendid qualities
and who enjoyed an enviable position in society she
once had as great a love and as deep a respect as for
her noble mother. Then she had to go through the
disastrous situation in the house. That experience
could but serve her as a warning against men, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
warning and a lesson! It could not but implant
deeply in her soul a lasting dread of man and of
man’s terrible passion. She naturally shrank back
from any close contact with man for there was always
a picture before her mind which plainly carried
the message: “do not trust any man lest you
should go through what your mother did!”</p>

<p>What might have been the future of this brave
girl if the father had not acted in that way, if the
marriage of the parents had been a happy one, if
she had not witnessed that terrible scene which impressed
her the more painfully because she had no
inkling whatever of the brutal side of sexuality?
I make bold to assert that she would have developed
into a quiet pleasant housewife and she would have
given vent to her homosexual tendencies along quiet
and innocent paths. But as it was she devoted herself
to girls and avoided men more and more. She
did permit herself to be attracted by men. But
they had to be married and unattainable. Thus
there could be no danger for her. When the husband
of a friend of hers of whom she also was very
fond declared that for her sake he would be willing
to divorce his wife, she fled and presently found
some other unreachable ideal to which she attached
herself. All her ideals were practically desexualized
while her sexuality she exercised exclusively on
women. <i>The love among women loomed up in her
mind as pure and elevating, while the love of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
she considered brutal. Even coitus seemed to her
a disgusting brutal act.</i></p>

<p>The traumatic incident occurred after puberty
yet it had a very tremendous effect. The question
rises whether the traumas occurring during childhood
may also influence the particular direction of
sexual development. This question has long since
been solved in harmony with <i>Binet’s</i> view and psychoanalysis
has taught us some additional facts regarding
the influence of traumas. The narrower
Freudian school has gone so far as to overvalue the
influence of traumas and has designated as traumas
certain relatively trivial experiences which do not
deserve that designation. I want to sound again a
warning against underestimating the role of traumas.
Certain minor fetichistic tendencies are
easily and sometimes fairly satisfactorily explained
on that basis, although the more complicated forms
of fetichism, such as we shall study later, are not to
be explained solely upon the theory of traumatic
causation. Here the association hypothesis of <i>Binet</i>
completely breaks down. We must bear in mind that
the neurotics conceive many traumas which in
reality did not occur and that their phantasy turns
innocent incidents into alleged traumas whenever it
suits the trend of their emotions to do so. The
neurotic’s memory serves him poorly and that is
also true of the homosexuals who construct a purely
homosexual life history for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>But are not first impressions of fundamental determinative
value for future development? <i>Jean
Paul</i> very appropriately declares: “<i>All first impressions
persist forever in the child!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wish to add here a couple of observations which
we owe to <i>Bloch</i> and which illustrate very well the
influence of first sexual impressions:</p>

<p>“I was about five years of age when during a walk
accompanied by the nursemaid I saw at some
distance a man in the act of masturbating; without
knowing what it was, the picture persisted in my
mind for years. In my dreams until my fourteenth
year a playmate occupied the chief role. At thirteen
years of age I fell in love with a school comrade
who took but little interest in me; what roused my
interest in him in particular was probably the fact
that he was the one who brought to the class information
about sexual matters. We removed to
another City and I lost sight of the boy. Although
I knew nothing specific about sex at the time I sought
contact with those who roused my feelings.</p>

<p>“A stranger, a man of about 35 years of age, enticed
me and as soon as he had me he carried on
pederasty with me. I felt that there was something
repulsive in what he was doing, but I was too weak
to oppose myself against his influence. In about
three months he disappeared. Now I knew what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
masturbation was especially as there had occurred
a number of orgies at school.</p>

<p>“At eighteen years of age I left school, and while
the others among my comrades began showing an
inclination towards the female sex I found myself
attracted in every way exclusively to man. Often
at the insistence of some of my friends I tried to
come into contact with women of the half world but
every time the attempt filled me only with disgust and
aversion. When I see a woman taking an interest
in me I am filled with a horrible feeling. That was
one more reason why I felt attracted to the male sex.
When I love a man I do not think (only) of sexual
attraction, but I seek to find in him precisely what
I, in turn, feel myself ready to give; exclusive devotion,
loyalty, tenderness; when I love a man,
everything else pales into insignificance for me.”
(<i>Bloch</i>, l.c., p. 565.)</p>

<p>It would seem that in this instance the memory of
the masturbating man, an incident which the boy
had witnessed during childhood, determined for him
the actual course of his sexual development. In the
previous case the trauma acted as a warning. In
this case it seems to have acted like a perpetual
stimulus, since a child does not possess the usual
moral scruples, and the first excitation (the sight of
the erect organ) must have been tremendous. That
picture stayed in his memory for years, it fixed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>self
and persisted permanently in that young man’s
memory. In the K. S. case, mentioned above, the
trauma was associated with disgust; it served as a
revulsion against heterosexuality.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In this particular case the memory of the incident
was associated with desire. It was utilized in
positive form as an inciter to homosexuality. Thus
we find that the problem is rather complicated. I
confess that for some time I was unable to see my
way clear in the midst of these facts so long as I
was one-sided in my views and thought that the condition
arises exclusively in one way. But I know
now that a number of paths may lead equally to
homosexuality and that this is a subject which requires
a much more thorough study. We must find
out whether psychic factors are invariably at work
behind every case of homosexuality or whether there
is an exclusively psychic and a specially organic
homosexuality. Such cases could be called pseudo-homosexuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>As a contribution to this question I find of interest
the following case, reported by Bloch, as the history
reveals the trauma and the bearing of the trauma
upon the development of the condition. It is a case
of male homosexuality:</p>

<p>“From my early childhood I was aware of something
peculiarly girlish in my whole nature outwardly
as well as inwardly (the latter in particular).
Sexual excitation I experienced also very early. <i>I
was about 6 years of age when I remember that a
private instructor seated himself on the edge of the
bed where I was lying ill with fever, petted me and
then membrum meum tetigit with his hand; the
pleasurable sensation which thus arose was so intense
that I cannot get it out of my mind to this day.</i> At
school where my conduct and studies were always
excellent I indulged occasionally in mutual ‘touching
games’ with other boys. I do not know on what
side of the family I may have inherited the unusual
intensity of my sexual desire, but I remember that
around my 12th year the flaring up of the instinct
caused me a great deal of unrest and when a comrade
once showed me how to masturbate it proved a welcome
relief. This ‘paradisaic’ state did not last
long and when I learned about the dangers and forbidden
features of my habit I had a terrific and
useless struggle with myself.</p>

<p>“I remember that as far back as my memory goes
I had the habit of <i>gazing at older, vigorous men</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
almost involuntarily and with a feeling full of longing,
without knowing what it meant. As to masturbation
I thought that I fell into the habit because
I had no chance to come into contact with women.
As a matter of fact I did occasionally entertain
friendly relations with certain girls who appeared to
be strongly attached to me; <i>but I always saw to it
that these love excitations were ‘nipped in the bud’</i>
because I was <i>afraid I should be unable to carry out
my role</i> to the end. Finally I decided to seek relief
among prostitutes, who were otherwise repellent to
my esthetic and moral sense, but the attempts proved
useless: either I found myself unable to carry out
the normal sexual act at all or if I did it, I experienced
no satisfaction and thereafter I was also
plagued with the fear of infection. I did have rather
frequently the opportunity to enter into amorous
relations with married women but I never did so even
though I inwardly scorned my shyness and my oversensitive
conscience. Although these facts are true,
I must not omit to mention the chief thing responsible
for the whole situation, namely, the fact
that I am homosexual in my inclination and that the
other sex has hardly any attraction for me.</p>

<p>“I believed myself totally unfit for ordinary sexual
relations when I found one day that the sight of the
<i>membrum virile</i> alone made the blood boil in me with
excitement. I then recalled that this had occasionally
happened before, although not to such a re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>markable
extent. Secretly I had to face the plain
fact that I was ‘not like others.’ This fact which
I had previously suspected and of which I grew
more and more convinced, brought me to the brink of
despair.</p>

<p>“Then it happened that a simple little girl fell
deeply in love with me, and I made up my mind to
start relations with her. During the time while this
lasted, a period of several months, my inclination towards
the male sex persisted though occasionally I
tried to subdue it; but to overcome it completely
was for me, I found, impossible. I was still keeping
up my relations with the girl when I once noticed
in a public lavatory an elderly gentleman who
appealed to me very strongly; he scrutinized me
carefully and bent over in order <i>membrum meum
videre</i>, came close by, moved forward his hand shaking
with excitement and ... <i>membrum meum tetigit</i>.
I was so surprised and scared that I ran off
at once and for some time after that I avoided passing
by that place. But my impulsion was the
greater on that account to meet that man again;
this was not at all difficult.... In this continuous
struggle, so meaningless and so useless, against an
instinct which was at least partly inborn in me, I
have squandered my best energies, although I have
long ago reached the point of realizing that in itself
the instinct is neither morbid nor sinful.” (<i>Bloch</i>,
l.c., P. 545.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Does not this case illustrate clearly the influence
of first impressions and the significance of the bisexual
foundation in the homosexual attitude? The
man is seduced by an elderly man and after that he
longs continually to be seduced by an elderly man,
in a manner recalling that unforgettable scene. Although
capable of heterosexual acts, this side of his
nature persists as a sort of compulsory tendency
and drives him again into the arms of elderly men to
seek that form gratification which was the first he
had ever experienced in his life. His heterosexual
leanings are repressed. He himself admits that he
always saw to it that all such love affairs were
nipped in the bud. In other words he is deliberately
fighting off all heterosexual stimuli and encouraging
the homosexual excitations. Then he arrives at
the realisation that he is not like others.... In fact
he is bisexual and has the capacity to act as a bisexual
being. A careful analysis would have disclosed
many interesting features. We wanted only
to show how this young man was continually seeking
to find his teacher (father?), and what a great deal
of neurotic overgrowth stood back of this desire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next case quoted from <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> is also
very remarkable:</p>

<p>A merchant, 34 years of age, mother neuropathic;
at 9 years of age was taught masturbation by a
schoolmate; also, homosexual relations with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
brother; fellatio; urolagnia; at 14 years of age first
love for a school colleague.</p>

<p><i>At 17 years of age his love ideal changes completely.
He is no longer attracted by young, beautiful
boys, but by decrepit old men.</i></p>

<p><i>T. traces this back to the fact that he had once
overheard his father in the next room uttering
pleasurable exclamations after he retired for the
night and this excited him tremendously because he
thought his father was ... (weil er sich den Vater
coitierend dachte).</i></p>

<p>Since that time old men carrying on various homosexual
deeds play a predominant role in his dream
pollutions and during masturbation. But even
through the day the sight of an old man is enough to
excite him, especially if the man is very old and decrepit
when his excitement may be so tremendous as
to end in ejaculation. Attempts at intercourse
with women in houses of prostitution proved unsuccessful
and ordinary men and boys do not rouse him.
From the age of 22 years on he carried on a platonic
love towards an old gentleman whom he met on the
latter’s daily walks. During these walks T. had
ejaculation. In order to free himself of this peculiar
dependence after several unsuccessful attempts
at intercourse with prostitutes <i>he took along with
him a decrepit old man whom he induced to have
coitus before his eyes. The scene so excited him
that he in turn proved potent. Later on he was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
to dispense with the old man’s presence and could
carry out the act successfully without that aid. But
this improvement did not last long; soon he became
impotent once more.</i></p>

<p>This case is in every way interesting and of great
significance for our problem. It proves to us the
great determinative role of a childish reminiscence
and the persistence of a scene which is continually
repeated in memory. The whole of that young
man’s libido is centered around that particular scene.
He stages it also in the brothel when he hires an old
man to have intercourse in his presence. That old
man assumes then the role of the father, the prostitute
is the mother, while he is once more the onlooking
child. The act of looking on so excites his passion
that with that aid he proves potent in his intercourse
with the prostitute. But that continues
only so long as the exciting influence of the scene
persists. After that he reverts to his former impotence
and he again ... seeks his father. It is
perfectly plain, and only the blind could fail to see
that T. seeks his father. His wish was obviously
that his father should also start something sexual
with him. It is possible that he had identified himself
with his mother. But we have no direct proof
of that. This is particularly significant because
<i>Sadger</i> and the others who belong to <i>Freud’s</i> narrower
circle place great emphasis upon the role of
the mother in the genesis of genuine homosexuality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
while neglecting ruefully the role of the father.
This case shows us a “Japhet, who seeks his father.”
The promenades with the respectable old gentleman
are repetitions of the walks with his father.</p>

<p>This patient does not recall any heterosexual experiences
during his youth, probably because the
memory of them has been repressed from consciousness.
In the other case which I shall now quote from
<i>Krafft-Ebing</i> the heterosexual period is clearly recalled.
I refer the reader to that author’s <i>Observation
144</i>. Here I quote the first part of the
history of that case:</p>

<p>“I am at the present time 31 years of age, lean yet
well built, devoted to male love, therefore unmarried.
My relatives were in good health, mentally
normal, there were two suicides in our family, on
mother’s side. My sexual feelings arose when I was
about seven years of age, the sight of the naked
abdomen being particularly exciting. I gratified
my instinct by allowing my sputum to trickle down
the abdomen. When I was eight years old we had
in our house a little nurse maid of about thirteen
years. I found it very pleasurable to rub my genitals
against hers, but there could be no coitus on
my part at that time. During the ninth year I
went to live among strangers and went to the gymnasium.
A colleague showed me his genitals and
that filled me with disgust. But in the family where
my parents arranged for me to board there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
very beautiful girl who prevailed upon me—I was but
little over nine years old at the time—to sleep with
her. I found the experience most pleasurable. My
penis, though small, was already capable of erection
and I had intercourse with her almost daily. This
continued for several months. Then my parents
transferred me to another gymnasium; I missed the
girl very much and during my tenth year I began to
masturbate. But the act inspired me only with disgust.
I masturbated but moderately, always felt
deeply remorseful afterwards, although I could discover
no bad consequences.”</p>

<p>Here is a man who actually felt disgust at the
sight of a friend’s genitals and who found intercourse
with women pleasurable. He is excellently
on the way to become a heterosexual. At fourteen he
falls in love with a school colleague, an experience
which every person goes through at about that age,
the “normal,” no less than the homosexual. After
the final examination (high school) he has intercourse
with girls and great pleasure in the act, but
he is already making use of some homosexual makeshifts.
Soldiers must precede him in the act of using
the prostitutes and the thought of having access to
a vagina which had just been in contact with another
penis, stimulates him. “At the same time I can
never kiss women without feeling disgust; <i>even my
relatives I kiss only on the cheek</i>.” ... <i>Hinc illæ
lacrimæ!</i> He protects himself against the sexual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
excitations emanating from his family circle. His
homosexuality is somehow linked to his family. The
peculiar action of a boy who allows sputum to trickle
down his abdomen, imagining that it is spermatic
fluid could probably be traced by means of analysis
to a definite childhood trauma. Particularly clear in
this case is the heterosexual attitude which under certain
influences and inhibitions merges almost imperceptibly
into the bisexual and homosexual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whether late homosexuality is determined every
time through definite traumatic incidents, I am unable
to state, because I have not had the opportunity
thoroughly to analyze such a case. The next case
seems to me to show that strong emotionally toned
episodes may turn a latent into manifest homosexuality:</p>

<p>An army officer, 46 years of age, consults me for
complete impotence with women. The impotence is
of four years’ duration. He has become acquainted
with a lady of whom he is very fond and who enjoys
an excellent financial status. He could now be a
happy man, if he only were a complete man. Asked
about his morning erections he blushes. The trouble
is not with erections, they do not fail him on other
occasions. He is impotent only in contact with
women. Finally he admits that since his 38th year
he has been carrying on homosexual relations. Since
that time his interest in women gradually vanished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
and he has become impotent. His anamnesis reveals
some significant facts. He recalls no homosexual
deeds or excitations during childhood and before
puberty. He was sexually precocious, masturbated
already during the primary school period and was
attracted by girls. First coitus at seventeen in a
house of prostitution. After that he felt he wanted
women very badly but had no homosexual inclination.
Then a tremendous experience came into his
life which agitated him and after that he was depressed
for some time. That was just before his
first homosexual act.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me something about the nature of
that agitation?”</p>

<p>“I find it painful to speak of it.”</p>

<p>“But you expect help in a rather difficult situation.
How should I appraise the situation in its true
light if you won’t furnish me the necessary information?”</p>

<p>“You are right. But there are things of which it
is almost impossible to speak. It is about my mother.
But I suppose I cannot help myself otherwise. I
must tell you all.</p>

<p>“I have always honored and respected my mother.
I was 38 years of age when I received a telegram
calling me to her sick bed. She passed away shortly
after my arrival. As the only son it was my duty to
put everything in order after her. I went through
her old correspondence and in a box I came across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
a mass of love letters. First I was not going to read
them. But curiosity got the best of me. I said to
myself: ‘every married person loves once in his or
in her life some one else, why should not that be
permitted to my mother when father died while she
was still very young.’ If I only had not done that!
I found not one letter, I found hundreds of letters
and ... they were not all from one man. The
letters were so vulgar, so plain, so cynical, so revolting
that I wished myself dead. I lost the holiest
thing in my life. Before then I always dreamed of
finding a woman like mother, and her type of womanhood
always stood before me as the ideal. Now I
found that she could be bought and she was to be
had for ordinary degrading purposes. The tone
which her lovers assumed in those letters was so revolting
that I imagined the worst. Since then I
feel a deep scorn for all womanhood. Shortly after
that I yielded to the temptations of a homosexual
friend....</p>

<p>“Do you believe that my impotence has some
relation to that occurrence? I have often thought
of it. Whenever I go to a woman I cannot help
thinking of the box in which I found mother’s letters.
After such an experience how is it possible
for one still to consider marriage?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A late homosexuality induced by a very tragic
experience. Naturally the man was always latently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
homosexual. But it was that experience which
turned him into a manifest homosexual. Unfortunately
I am unable to state whether he married the
woman and became heterosexual again or not, because
I never saw him after that.</p>

<p>The reader will observe that in this chapter I have
quoted quite a number of cases culled from the reports
of other practitioners. I do this for a double
reason. First, I want to prove, on the basis of
other material than my own, that homosexuality has
its psychogenesis; and, in the second place, I aim
by this means to disprove the contention unfortunately
rather widespread in some circles and actually
expressed by some critics, that my case histories correspond
to the “genius loci.” As if the Viennese
differed in sexual matters from the North-German
or from the Englishman! My material is derived
from the world at large. <i>I have been unable to discover
thus far any difference with respect to sexual
matters between any two nations, except that one
may keep things under cover more cleverly than the
other.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This series of cases aiming to illustrate the rôle
of psychic trauma in sexuality may be concluded
with the following case, reported by <i>Pfister</i> (l. c. p.
169):</p>

<p>A 28-year-old woman, member of an educational
institution, of high moral repute, is in despair be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>cause
she fears she is no longer able to control her
homosexual longings. If she meets a young girl she
is nearly overpowered with the impulse to kiss her
then and there. The unknown girl’s face haunts her
for weeks afterwards and she can not sleep tortured
with regret because she did not gratify her impulse
to kiss the girl as she does with her acquaintances.
She is particularly distracted at the thought that
with her tendernesses and attentions, she may mislead
into homosexual counter-affection a fourteen-year-old
girl who is close to her, although nothing out of
the way has happened between them. But the little
friend already trembles with excitement when she is
embraced and her great affection leads her to tears
if she does not see her beloved often enough.</p>

<p>Our homosexual girl had a physically attractive
but otherwise insignificant, nervous father who left
the conduct of his business to the capable hands of
his energetic and intelligent wife. The little daughter
learned early to admire her mother and to look
upon her father as a “light weight.” As a small girl
she was normal. She played equally with boys and
girls. With her playmates of both sexes she underwent
various sexual experiences: the girls played the
game of doctor and this gave them an opportunity
to touch the sexual parts, and a small, ailing boy who
was one of the girl’s playmates between her seventh
and ninth years, did the same thing. Around the age
of eight years she fell in love with an uncle who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
the habit of throwing her playfully into the air, a
game which always gave her a very peculiar feeling.
<i>At ten or eleven years of age a 40-year old housekeeper
abused her repeatedly.</i> Definitely homosexuality
broke out when the girl was thirteen. She
was at the time a great deal in the company of a
teacher who resembled her mother in many ways but
who was better educated. That passionate woman
was distinctly homosexual and for two years she
treated the girl with greatest affection. During that
time her passion for kissing developed while the
grossly sexual cravings which the sensuous housekeeper
had roused in her gradually quieted down. A
few love affairs with boys also led to kisses but she
experienced no particular passion in that connection.
Those affairs she took up as a pastime and to be
in fashion rather than because she was interested.</p>

<p>At the boarding school her one-sided erotic inclination
was further developed in the course of
passionate friendships. At the age of nineteen she
made a couple of heterosexual erotic attempts but
they proved unsuccessful. The first affair was with
a hot-blooded artist of womanly appearance. Her
love was deep, the young girl floated in ideal conversations
and gladly exchanged kisses with the
young man. After his departure they maintained
a warm correspondence full of tenderness but without
giving one another any formal promise.</p>

<p>Five or six weeks after parting from the beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
friend she became engaged to a smart young man
because she was in despair and she had given up the
plan of a higher education for herself as she was
not getting along at all well with a relative at home.
She thought she loved her young man but soon after
the engagement she began fearing that she had perhaps
undertaken more than she intended to carry
out. The soft, shy young man apparently resembled
her father. For seven months she played at being in
love, vomitted every morning and wished she were
dead. Finally she gave up her engagement and concentrated
all her feelings upon members of her own
sex. She maintained however her delicate womanly
sensitiveness throughout and always gave the impression
of a girlish creature. So long as she found
homosexual gratification, she took little interests in
a career, or in nature, art and religion; but as soon
as her inclinations were thwarted, her ideal interests
came strongly to the foreground. She herself compared
these vacillations with the movements of a
pair of scales.</p>

<p>When she felt deeply in love she was fairly free
of grossly sexual excitations. But during her loveless
engagement <i>she felt herself sexually roused a
number of times when the young man played with her
in a thoroughly respectable manner</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pfister</i> then relates that the young woman interrupted
the analysis just as she was making rapid
progress towards recovery. But he adds a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
of interesting details, including her first dream,
which usually contains the nucleus of the neurosis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first dream is as follows:</p>

<p><i>A cat bit me on the left index finger and held on
to it for some time. The finger swelled and burst down
to the bone. The tendon was broken and a great
deal of fluid was oozing out. It meant I shall always
have a stiff finger. I said to myself: “What a pity!
Now I won’t be able ever to play the piano again.”</i></p>

<p><i>I woke up and found my finger so fast asleep that
I could not move it.</i></p>

<p>Just before the dream the girl in her despair had
offered a fervent prayer which made her feel a little
easier. Before the analysis the girl was extremely
restless and longed for her beloved, but she said to
herself that she would only bring misfortune upon
that poor girl’s head.</p>

<p>The analysis of this dream, which <i>Pfister</i> unfortunately,
did not carry out with complete success,
shows that her whole emotional life is governed by
the infantile experience with that housekeeper. The
first recollection brought up by the free associations
with this dream relate to the housekeeper, who
in the dream is represented by the cat.</p>

<p>I have discussed elsewhere in a lengthy contribution,
the <i>Representation of the Neurosis in Dreams</i>.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
In this dream the trouble is symbolized by a stiff
finger. “Playing the piano” is again a symbol
for sexual intercourse as well as for masturbation.
Probably the symbol here has acquired its emotional
coloring from the masturbation habit. But the heterosexual
meaning is also obvious (piano playing—coitus).
If we interpret the dream we have:</p>

<p>The housekeeper, that false cat who played a dependent
rôle towards my parents, made me ill with
her long-continued tendernesses (A cat bit me on
the left index finger and held on for a long time).
The trouble grew worse, something valuable tore
in me (the ability to love a man) and the homosexual
form of love established itself permanently (stiffening).
Now I am incapable of loving a man, I cannot
be a mother or raise a family of my own,—a wish that
has already cost me so many tears (the water flowing
out of the wound).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps this interpretation will be doubted as
something artificial and rather forced. But the subject
recalls further details of the dream and relates
them subsequently. Such additions are of extraordinary
significance because usually they contain
the censured, the repressed material. She recalls
that the cat was going to bite her at first on the
foot (significant because of the proximity of the
sexual parts). Further on she relates a continuation
of the dream:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p><i>The water flowed down the steps. I ran to a
friendly woman physician for aid to my wound. On
the way I met her unexpectedly in the neighborhood
of a merry-go-round. Then my sister speaks up saying:
“She will fix your finger in good shape right
away.” The woman physician retorts: “I am sorry,
but I do not operate.” She sends me instead to a
surgeon (male).</i></p>

<p>The interpretation is not difficult. There is a
great deal of weeping. Her tears inundate her whole
soul (House as symbol of soul). At first she is looking
for a woman healer. A woman shall cure her
trouble. Life is a merry-go-round, everything in
life revolves, she may yet be happy. But the woman
physician gave her the correct answer. You need a
surgeon. <i>Only a man can heal thee.</i> I do not operate.
I am not the one to awaken your femininity
(defloration?).</p>

<p>A further supplementary account shows that the
finger became the muzzle of a repeating revolver.
<i>Pfister’s</i> interpretation that this is a phallic symbol
and that it shows the dreamer’s phantasy that she
was a male with a phallus, may be correct. Every
homosexual woman has the wish to transpose the
psychic state into an actual physical condition. But
another possible meaning of the repeating fire arm
seems to me more plausible. The subject’s traumatic
incident had the effect of facilitating subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
other homosexual experiences. <i>The traumatic experience
required repetition.</i></p>

<p>I pass over for the present the other meanings of
the dream (over-determination), which <i>Pfister</i> discloses
with keen insight. I am concerned here merely
with pointing out the determining influence of a
trauma. Naturally there are other factors at work
along with the traumatic incident, it would be necessary
to find out why the incident influenced her in
that particular manner, the precise constellation of
her family circle ought to be taken into consideration,
etc. But the dream points so clearly to the
cause of the psychic trauma that the cross section
it furnishes enables us to reconstruct the whole picture
of her trouble.</p>

<p>The case is convincing also from another standpoint.
The subject gave up early her psychoanalysis
because she felt in a short time that she was well.
These apparent cures which serve to circumvent the
danger of a thorough psychoanalysis, are well known
occurrences. The subject is unwilling to acknowledge
that she is also heterosexually predisposed, that her
whole longing, in fact, is directed towards the fulfilment
of motherhood. The dream says plainly: <i>“I
want to be a woman, like all other women, I want
to bear children! Save me from the danger of homosexuality!”</i></p>

<p>But her consciousness is unprepared to acknowl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>edge
this desire. She meets difficulties upon the heterosexual
path. <i>Pfister</i> believes that she identified
herself with her father. In that sense the kissing
episodes (with girls) signify: <i>I let father</i> (who was
a very handsome and well appearing man) <i>kiss me</i>!
But her mother was also in the habit of kissing her
with great show of affection. It appears thus that
the most varied forces were at work to determine
the fixation (stiffening) of her emotional attitude.</p>

<p>In fact homosexuality does resemble ankylosis.
The free operation of sexuality appears to be restricted,
a single point is fixed and every movement
takes place thereafter only within the range of that
point of fixation.</p>

<p>Is it possible for psychoanalysis to loosen up
such psychic ankyloses and to free once more the
bound-down energies? In this particular case can
psychoanalysis remove the fear of man and the
woman’s doubt whether she can fill a woman’s rôle?
How far reaching are the possibilities of psychic
orthopedics in the case of homosexuals?</p>

<p>I must ask the reader to follow me patiently
through the complex inquiries which follow before
attempting to answer these questions.</p>

<p>Investigators interested in the problem of homosexuality
point out that the condition occurs in
families and see therein a support for the contention
that this condition is inborn. Homosexuals usually
have a homosexual brother or sister, or one or the
other of their parents is similarly afflicted, in spite
of marriage. But if we think of neurosis and of
homosexuality (which is a particular form of neurosis)
as a retrogression, if we bear in mind that all
neurotics show a marked overemphasis of sexual
traits, the reason for these facts is plain. What is
inherited is not the homosexuality but the powerful
bisexual disposition which leads to morbid tendencies.
Furthermore we must bear in mind that the influence
of family life is practically the same for all children.
Yet one child escapes lasting injury while another
is tremendously handicapped.</p>

<p>Before looking more closely into the influence of
family life upon the development of homosexuality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
we must point out two very significant considerations.</p>

<p>One of these is the division of all love into spiritual
and physical; the next point is the double attitude
of every homosexual as male and female. For the
present I need only emphasize the fact that persons
readily adjust themselves so that one sexual component
is expressed on the spiritual, the other upon
the physical plane. Let us call spiritual love, “erotism,”
and physical love, “sexuality.” The average
homosexual applies his erotism to male friendships
and his sexuality he places in the service of heterosexual
love; the progress of culture consists therein
that heterosexual love is also gradually sublimated,
that is, turned more and more into erotism. The
homosexual, for instance, turns his erotism towards
women, and applies his sexuality in his relation with
men. But at times he may turn his whole erotism
into the homosexual channel and suppress his whole
sexuality. Or he may endeavor to find certain spiritual
qualities in his sexual ideal, trying to turn also
part of his erotism into the homosexual path. Thus
we meet most remarkable variations. For an example
we may mention the homosexual who is interested
only in coachmen, soldiers, servants and peasants.
His sexual ideal he finds only among the lower
orders. Such a man has turned his whole erotism
towards women. He seeks the friendship of mature
women, sometimes also the company of fine men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
but sexually he can be active only in contact with
men of low order.</p>

<p>This peculiarity already indicates a judgment-attitude
in sexual matters. Sexuality is perceived as
degrading, as compelling a return to the first aspects
of “natural” life. The attitude is further complicated
by the homosexual’s overemphasis of one or
the other sex during his acts. If he is an active
homosexual he preserves his individuality, identifying
his selfhood with some male ideal, the father, the
brother, the teacher, etc. On the other hand, if he
plays a passive rôle, he identifies himself with a woman,
the mother, or her polar obverse, the prostitute.
Occasionally he carries on both rôles and the relations
between sexuality and erotism become reversed
and transposed. That is what complicates the problem
so tremendously. The urning transfers his
erotism to men and his sexuality is roused in relation
with women only, but the latter is soon turned into
disgust. Or the urlind loves spiritually only women
and finds all men repulsive, unbearable and disgusting.</p>

<p>In order to acquire a psychologic insight into
every case as it presents itself, and to judge of its
significance, it is necessary to answer the question:
what does the homosexual aim to accomplish with
his actions? What does the homosexual act represent
in the subject’s fancy. In most cases of this
character reality does not enter into consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>Some obscure and baffling paraphilias lose their
extraordinary character once we get at the specific
act which the subject repeats vicariously through his
overt action. For <i>Nietzsche’s</i> law of the eternal return
of sameness applies to the neurotic.</p>

<p>The acts which the neurotic carries out are either
something experienced or something wished, some unreached
yearning. It is part of human nature that
the unattained experience exercises a stronger driving
power than what has been experienced. Experience
acts as a retrospective tendency, craving
is prospective. (One might say, therefore: the most
severe traumas are those which have never been experienced.)
The unsatisfied craving is the motive
power of most neuroses. The “world pain” of all
those who are weary of life and who struggle in vain
to accomplish the impossible is due to the eternal
craving, the <i>eternally Lost</i>, the <i>perennially Unreachable</i>.
All the dream fancies of the neurotic are
shattered in contact with reality. For that reason
the neurotic overlooks the world’s standards and
builds a world of his own, wherein he is master and
attains all his wishes as dreams. The <i>unattained
experiences</i> furnish the material for <i>perennial
dreams</i>.</p>

<p>The formation of man’s character traits begins
during the first years of life. He tests his powers
upon the surroundings and his environment furnish
him the picture of life. In the eyes of children who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
are not self-reliant the father must be a giant because
he overawes them with his genial appearance
and his image generates in their soul a feeling of
inferiority which marks them for life. Every child
has an ambition: to excel his father. This wish may
express itself first in the desire to attain father’s
size, to be as strong and big as he. But later the
wish shows itself in that quiet but determined competitive
struggle which has always existed between
father and son, or mother and daughter. The strong
son takes after the powerful father. But suppose
the father is weak and the mother is the one who
dominates the house? What sort of picture of life
becomes imprinted upon the child’s mind under the
circumstances? Can it help believing that women
dominate the world, can he escape taking the attitude
either of wishing to be a woman and rule, or of fleeing
from woman when she clashes with his “will to
power” as man?</p>

<p>In the conflict that follows, sexuality becomes
mixed up with erotism, the soul of the child is bewildered,
a definite outcome is delayed and meanwhile
the child’s soul is filled with anxiety and doubt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Alfred Adler</i>, who has followed this line of inquiry
with great keenness, has conceived it an important
factor in the dynamics of the neuroses and he has
described this picture as “<i>the male protest</i>.” All reactions
and protective constructions or fictions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
the neurotic, according to him, lead back to the
desire to be “<i>a complete man</i>.” Homosexuality displays
this protest under a peculiarly cryptic form.
The homosexual cries out: <i>I want to be a woman!</i>
He may even go so far as to dress himself like a
woman and become a transvestite. <i>Adler</i> here gives a
far fetched explanation, saying: <i>this is a male protest
under the use of female means</i>! He holds that
the homosexual attempts to heighten by this means
his feeling of personality; the latter turns away from
woman because he fears his inferiority, he avoids
decisions. That is true of some aspects but not of
the whole picture. The problem of homosexuality as
a whole shows <i>Adler’s</i> position to be untenable.</p>

<p>The important thing is that there arises in the
child’s soul a wish which gravitates in the direction
of the parallelogram of forces exhibited within the
family circle. If the mother plays the upper rôle,
the wish becomes: <i>I should like to be like mother! I
should like to dominate and rule as she does!</i> Love
for the mother increases this tendency to become
identified with her and turns it into a directive ideal.
The child begins at a tender age to imitate its mother,
acts womanly, wants to play with dolls and cook,
wears gladly girls’ clothes. The child may overcome
these tendencies or it may grow up with them or
return to them later and become a pronounced homosexual.
(<i>Late Homosexuality.</i>)</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity I am now speaking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
boys. The same effect may be brought about when a
brutal father trods down the mother, the child sees
its mother suffer and comes to look upon his father
as an abhorrent example. Under such circumstances
the child’s “<i>will to power</i>” may turn into “<i>ethical
will</i>.” The child’s wish then is: <i>I would not rule
and be like father; I would rather be like mother!</i>
If the child loves his tyrannical father he may become
homosexual and passive: a woman and a strong
man.</p>

<p>These are a few examples taken at random from
life. I have brought them out, because one often
hears that homosexuals have had an energetic mother,
and a father who played a submissive rôle. Of
course, the contrary may also be the case. Frequently
we hear that the mother was strongly neurotic....
There are no definite rules in the psychogenesis
of homosexuality. Each case requires an
individual solution. That is why <i>Sadger’s</i> statements
on the subject cannot be taken as absolute
axioms. Every third case or so disproves his notions.</p>

<p><i>Many paths lead to homosexuality.</i> It would be
impossible to describe all. We can only get at a
few typical examples.</p>

<p>We turn our attention now to the important question:
what is the attitude of the neurotic towards
his mother? We have seen that psychoanalysts correlate
homosexuality to the repressed love for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
mother. Let us give a glimpse at my few statistical
data. The question: “Are you specially fond of your
mother or your father? Or are you partial to some
brother or sister?” was answered by my 20 homosexuals
as follows:</p>

<p>“Only of mother—mother—no particular preference—both
alike—mother—father—no preference—on
the whole, more fond of mother—love the whole
family passionately—father—mother—my father
mother—mother—mother—mother—specially fond
of a brother (indifferent to all the others)—father—mother.”</p>

<p>Approximately one-half confess a greater fondness
for the mother. I have mentioned the preferences
in these cases because in one of them, at least,
I am able positively to prove that back of love for
the mother is hidden really a powerful aversion
against the father; another subject had failed to
mention his fondness for his sister which played a
tremendous rôle in the development of his homosexuality.
Such a statistical inquiry really requires
documentation through psychoanalysis. But even
on the face of the statistical figures we find a certain
percentage of cases showing a greater fondness for
the mother. This is also true of some of the cases
in which the predominant love had been declared in
favor of the father.</p>

<p><i>Hirschfeld</i> holds that the attachment of the urning
to his mother is a common occurrence. He states:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>“The homosexual is attracted to one woman with
particular tenderness; <i>this is his mother</i>; and here
we also find the analogy of a particularly intimate
relationship between the urning daughter and her
father. The homosexual’s attachment to his mother
is so typical, that the <i>Freudian</i> school has described
this mother-complex as the cause of homosexuality.
<i>I hold this deduction for a false one.</i> The homosexual
does not become an urning because he was so
passionately attached to his mother as a child; on
the contrary, he leans towards the mother instinctively
rather than knowingly, at first, this being the
direction of his weakness and peculiarity and often
his mother, also instinctively, makes him her favorite
child....”</p>

<p>This conclusion of <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> I find myself unable
to accept. The urning is often the mother’s
favorite child before his birth. The child responds
with the most tender love for his mother with whom
he identifies himself in the end. Sometimes the mother
wishes a girl and brings up her boy as one. I know
one urning who was never dressed in pantelets by his
mother, who was always kept by her side and whose
mother was in the habit of folding his external
genital over with his skin, saying: <i>you are a girl</i>!
Even as a grown up boy he was frequently put in
girl’s clothes and he preserved for some time a tendency
to transvestism.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there are many cases, in which direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
love for the mother has absorbed all love for the
female sex.</p>

<p>One urning, for instance, as quoted by <i>Hirschfeld</i>,
states:</p>

<p>“My mother was everything to me, she was my one
best friend, the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> of my existence. I
had built many pretty plans for her, desiring to
make her comfortable in her old age.... Then,
there came the terrible catastrophe, which nearly
wiped out my whole existence, death robbed me of
my much-beloved mother. The report of her illness,
which made me fear the worst, found me in the North
of Ireland and the tortures which I endured during
the two days and two nights that it took me to reach
home, could not be described in mere words. On the
train folks avoided me suspecting that I was insane....
For three weary weeks I took care of my mother
day and night, then God took her from me, and I
remained a lonely wanderer, broken in mind and
body. It was a blow from which I could never
recover. In the endeavor to forget I returned to my
England to take up my former work but it was useless.
Forget I could not, day and night I was a prey
to mental and physical suffering. I could not stand
it any longer. So I returned to the old home where
my people had lived for 100 years. Sometimes I
was nearly insane and felt a little more quiet only
when visiting the cemetery and hovering around my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
parents’ resting place. Unable to find peace I decided
to travel. In the churches and cathedrals of
every City and in the chapels of every village through
which I passed I prayed to God for the soul of my
beloved mother. The gnawing anguish in my heart
over the death of my beloved mother had shattered
my nerves all to pieces.... I felt myself paralyzed
on account of my deep depression, I could no longer
think, I fell into melancholy although I sometimes
tried to rouse myself. I abandoned all correspondence
because no one could write me a consoling word.
When the world which existed between mother and
myself shattered, life ceased to have any interest
for me.”</p>

<p>The relationship of the urlind to the father and
of the urning to the mother <i>Hirschfeld</i> summarizes
in the following table:</p>

</div>

<p>The powerful influence of the mother in bringing
up the child is illustrated by the following passage
from one history:</p>

<p>“A young lieutenant relates: as soon as I was
out of the school room I used to rush to my girl
friends. My mother was fond of taking me along
when she went shopping and always asked me how
I liked this thing and that, before making a purchase.
For every new hat which mother bought I
served as a model, that is, every hat was tried on
my head, and mother purchased for herself the hat
that looked best when tried on me. ‘You look like
a little girl,’ mother often would say to me while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
the hats were tried on, ‘too bad, that you are not a
real girl!’” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>, l. c., p. 113.)</p>

<p>The expression, “too bad, you are not a real girl,”
shows how the mother influenced the child’s soul at
a time when it is so very plastic. But <i>Hirschfeld</i>
maintains that the conditions were reversed; that the
parents had suspected the child’s homosexual inclination
and treated it accordingly:</p>

<p>“Often the disposition towards homosexuality is
fostered in children by their elders who treat them
according to that leaning. The fathers feel specially
attracted to the urning daughters—the mothers
fondly give their urning boys girlish tasks about the
house. The feminine and the virile peculiarities are
not brought out through training at first; the mother
would not expect girlish tasks of a boy who was not
in the first place inclined that way. When <i>Krafft-Ebing</i>
relates in his description of the case of the
<i>Countess Sarolta Vay</i>: ‘it was her father’s whim to
bring up S. as a boy; he let her ride, drive, hunt,
admired her virile energy, called her Sandor. On
the other hand this foolish parent allowed his second
son to be dressed like a girl and to be brought up
very much like one’—we must credit the father with
the intention of meeting deliberately an outspoken
tendency on the part of his children.” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>,
l. c., p. 112.)</p>

<p>Naturally when one explains everything so arbitrarily
and tries to interpret in the parent’s favor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
suggesting that the father displayed great psychic
insight, anything may be proven.</p>

<p>But when one looks with open eyes at this observation
and at another case of <i>Hirschfeld’s</i>,—an
important contribution because it illustrates the
whole inner condition of the homosexual,—it is not
difficult to draw one’s own conclusions. One urning
relates about his mother:</p>

<p>“In the midst of his worries he was suddenly embraced
and kissed—his mother held him tightly in
her arms; she drew his little face to her cheek and
their tears mingled while she consoled him until
his eyes again mirrored a smile. These were unforgettable
experiences in the life of the homosexual
child. He felt that his mother was his truest friend,
and in his grateful heart he planned to recompense
her above all other mothers. His whole life and hope
was centered in her; it was for her sake that he
was willing to prepare his school lessons, and because
of her he avoided arousing his father’s wrath;
he did not want her to be scolded on his account. To
make her happy was his ambition in life. Because
she was not happy, he felt as if it were his fault
and with redoubled tenderness he clung to her, the
quiet sufferer.</p>

<p>“He reached 16 years of age, he became sexually
ripe and a perplexing unrest troubled him. His
comrades told him about their gallant adventures.
But he remained unresponsive to everything that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
seemed to make them so happy. On the contrary, he
was terribly distressed when his best friend ‘betrayed’
him in favor of a girl. He began to be
aware of his peculiarity and the terrible thought that
he must hide his awful feelings made him tremble.
He tried very hard to turn into the right path. But
he could not live at home while harboring his secret;
his mother, whom he loved above all else, he wanted
to spare; he felt he had to leave; so he abandoned his
home and went into the world trying to direct
properly his sexual feelings. While away he received
most tender messages from his mother to whom he
wrote as to a beloved. After an absence of two years
he returned home. From that time on his life developed
<i>under the eyes of his mother, in whom he
saw the highest quintessence of all womanhood</i>. His
relations with women were marked by timidity. He
adored them and felt he would like to serve them.
He became early their confessor for his womanly soul
made him their natural comrade. But in the midst
of all he was very unhappy, his feelings for them
never turned into physical love—<i>the sexual attraction
was absent</i>.” (<i>Hirschfeld</i>, l. c., p. 105.)</p>

<p>This urning actually confessed, in his own words,
that in his mother he saw the quintessence of all
womanhood. The condition is obvious. Every
woman represents the mother, in part. At first I
had occasion to observe cases of this kind and that
is how I came to the hasty conclusion that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
homosexual is emotionally fixed upon his mother and
avoids women because his inhibition towards them is
due to the mother <i>Imago</i> which he carries within
him.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another observation of <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> seems to me
of very great interest:</p>

<p>“The great attachment of homosexuals to their
mother as pointed out by <i>Sadger</i> and other followers
of <i>Freud</i> is really a fact and holds true of nearly
all homosexuals, the attachment reaching far back
into their own childhood and extending over the
mother’s whole life. We have seen that many who
lost their mother at an advanced age, for a long
time were unable to recover from the blow. But it
seems more proper not to look upon this great attachment
to the mother as the cause of homosexuality,
but as a consequence thereof. Aside from this
more feminine nature, absence of a home of his
own keeps the homosexual for a longer time than
usual close to his mother, especially when she possesses
a more pronounced personality, which is rather
not unusual where the children are homosexual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
Urnings who contract marriage are not wound up
emotionally in their mother quite to such an extent
and often their love is transferred to their wife.”
(<i>Hirschfeld</i>, l. c., p. 344.)</p>

<p>With these words and the admission of the transference
of the love for the mother to some other
female person <i>Hirschfeld</i> recognizes the possibility
of healing the condition, which is the psychoanalyst’s
task. But I must warn against any tendency to
solve the problem of homosexuality on the basis of
any single finding.</p>

<p>In the first place I must point out that the history
of these cases discloses two types of motherhood:
the strong mother and the weak mother. Both
types are common and either or both may determine
the growth of the child. <i>Hirschfeld</i> states that the
urning becomes readily attached to the mother who is
strong. This corresponds with my practical observations
and shows one type of homosexuality which I
shall presently describe. The strong mother dominates
a weak child throughout his life, he never
escapes her and she determines his relations to other
women.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be of interest to record on this question the
opinion of a man who is looked upon as the spiritual
leader of the homosexual circle in a cosmopolitan
city, a man who has organized them and who has had
considerable experience. This gentleman writes me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>
“My Dear Doctor:<br />
</p>

<p>“In conformity with your wish I am sending you
herewith a number of life histories.</p>

<p>“First I wish to report to you the result of a
questionnaire; I have reached with the questionnaire
800 persons. It is noteworthy that none of them
knew that the answer to the question was of any
particular interest to me, for the question and the
answer came up unobtrusively in the course of ordinary
conversation. This disposes of the criticism
sometimes heard in medical circles that the answers
to interrogatories are of little or no worth because
the respondents unconsciously report things in a
manner to favor themselves if they do not deliberately
tell falsehoods with that end in view.</p>

<p>“Among the 800 persons interrogated 65% stated
that the mother was unusually energetic and self-reliant,
while the father was mild and easy going,
as well as diffident and easily influenced.</p>

<p>“In my opinion these 65% represent the hereditary
cases; there may be some also among the other 35%
due to hereditary transmission but this, of course,
I am unable to ascertain and it would be interesting
to conduct a medical inquiry into the subject.</p>

<p>“In favor of a hereditary predisposition as the
most general factor stands also the fact that in many
families the homosexual’s sisters or brothers show
a similar tendency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>


<p><i>Illustrations</i></p>

<p>U. Sch., 26 years of age, a merchant. The mother
extraordinarily self-reliant and the one who determines
the course of action in every family emergency.
Father good-natured fellow, easily influenced.
U. Sch. has been several years ago under the care
of Prof. Pilz. At the time he had some intercourse
with women, but the act always caused him disgust
and did not diminish his need to get into contact
with men. At first he tried to oppose this leaning
towards men, but after two months of struggle—during
which he lost considerable weight—he had to
give in again and today he maintains relations exclusively
with men. His brother, six years younger
than he, is an actor and is also homosexual. An
older brother, also a merchant, is completely normal
in his sexual life, but far from self reliant and very
moody. His sister is also heterosexual, but has male
traits and physical features, hairy growth on the
face and a bass voice which would be considered
very low even in a man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Count X., 25 years old; a very energetic mother.
His gait and movements are exceedingly feminine,
he is careless and has been mixed up already in a
number of unpleasant affairs from which the writer
successfully helped him extricate himself. Two of
his three brothers are also homosexual, and of his
family circle in the wider sense, two uncles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>


<p>Karl W., 28 years of age, bank clerk. For the
past six years has maintained relations with his older
colleagues. He is very strikingly feminine and
anxiety appears to lend zest to life in his case. He
is continually living in dread lest some one in his
family should find out about his peculiar inclination,
although he is a stranger here and has no relative
living nearby. But if he has no reason to fear anything
on this score he finds some other reason to
keep his mind in torment. For instance, he fears he
will be run over by an automobile, even when he strolls
along the safe side of a side walk, etc. As he is otherwise
mentally normal I conclude that he has a strong
masochistic tendency which he satisfies thus by conjuring
up absurd fears. There is no expression of
the masochistic tendency in any overt acts. On the
other hand K. has relations only with persons belonging
to the lowest social stratum (plasterers,
drivers, etc.) and it is probable that the greater
danger in that connection serves as a stimulant for
him.</p>

<p>His mother is normal, but a very energetic
woman, always taking care of her own affairs and
when a couple of thieves once broke in at her home
she grappled with them, threw them to the ground
and held them. She has married a second time, has a
slight downy beard growth, and in her house often
puts on male clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>We need not be surprised that the expert emphasizes
the fact that in many instances homosexuality
occurs in groups in the same family. The same conditions
bring about similar effects. Even the fact
that 65% of homosexuals have a very energetic
mother need not be in itself of any particular significance
as typical of the psychogenesis of homosexuality.
The expert really means that these are
mannish women so that they naturally bring into the
world womanly boys.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> This view of <i>Krafft-Ebing</i> is by no means “antiquated.” It
is still maintained by <i>Stier</i> (Zur Aetiologie des kontraeren
Sexualgefuehls. Monatschrf. f. Psych, u. Neurol., vol. XXXII,
1914) and very energetically criticised (ibid.) by <i>Hirschfeld
and Burchard</i>. “It is inconceivable,” state the above named
authors, “how <i>Stier</i> can ascribe an etiologic significance to
onanism in connection with homosexuality. Its distribution,
ubiquitous—in the opinion of most specialists, would permit
one to hold masturbation responsible for any other sexual
development as well.” According to <i>Stier</i>, early and long-continued
onanism (especially mutual) is harmful because
“it does away with the feeling of shame in connection with
one’s sexual organs and makes for readier handling even by
the uncorrupted adult.” <i>Fleischmann</i> also finds 33 excessive
onanists among 60 inverts and concludes (Beitr. zur Lehre der
kontraeren Sexualempfindung, Zeitschr. f. d. ges. Neur. u.
Psychol., vol. VII, 1911) that “like alcoholism, masturbation
must influence the development of the perversion.” Many of
his patients mentioned the habit in a casual relation. We
know well that the sense of guilt is attached to the habit of
masturbation. But <i>Fleischmann</i> sees in that a proof. “Onanism
plays a role in the development of the sexual perversion,”
he argues, “because it rouses an increased sexual excitability
while the will power is weakened by it at the same time and
there follows a progressive wandering of the sexual instinct
away from the normal sexual aim and object.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> This contention is altogether wrong. I have never seen so
many and such pronounced idealists as among masturbators.
Young artists, poets and musicians in particular often show,
I have found, a strong tendency to masturbation, and this
agrees with the pronounced bisexuality of all artists, which has
been particularly pointed out by <i>Fliess</i>. The youths of this
type are often so delicate and sensitive that they see in the
sexual act only animal brutality and hide their own sexuality
from the whole world. Among masturbators we find the
champions of truth, the over-moralistic preachers, the ethical
reformers and dreamers.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Cf., on the other hand, the views of <i>Bloch</i>: “That the contrary
sexual instinct-feeling in itself is not a sign of psychic
degeneration and need not be looked upon at all as morbid,
is shown among others, by the fact that the condition is often
associated with spiritual superiority. As proof we find, among
all nations, men of proven homosexuality, who are the pride
of their respective people as writers, poets, artists, military
strategists, or statesmen. Further proof that the contrary
sexual feeling is no disease and does not necessarily lead to
immoral tendencies may be seen in all the noble qualities of
heart which it is capable of generating, precisely as the
heterosexual attraction, such as courage, self-sacrifice, altruism,
artistic feeling, creative energy, etc., just as it may be responsible
also for any of the morbidities and failings of heterosexual
love (jealousy, suicide, murder, unhappy love with its
deleterious effects on mind and body, etc.)”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> It was clearly the duty of the new editor of <i>Krafft-Ebing’s</i>
popular work to have recorded therein the author’s latest
views. In his “<i>Neuen Studien auf dem Gebiete der Homosexualitaet</i>,”
he states: “In contrast with the conception that
contrary sexuality is an inborn anomaly, a disorder in the
evolution of the sexual function of monosexuals and of the
glandular development of the sex glands, <i>the conception of
‘morbidity’ is untenable</i>. We may rather speak in this connection
of a malformation and compare the anomaly with
bodily malformations,—for instance, with the anatomic deviations
from the average type. But the concept of a simultaneous
psychopathic state remains a legitimate assumption, because
subjects presenting anatomic as well as functional deviations
from type (<i>stigmata degenerationis</i>), <i>may preserve good
physical health for a time, and may even show points of
superiority</i>.</p>

<p>“At the same time so tremendous a deviation as contrary
sexual feeling must have a far wider influence upon the psyche
than many of the anatomic or functional stigmata of degeneration.
That is the reason why any disturbance in the usual
development of a normal sexual life reflects so commonly in
an unfavorable sense upon the harmonious psychic development
of personality. <i>Victims of contrary sexual feeling often show
neuropathic and psychopathic predispositions</i>, such as, for instance,
a tendency to constitutional neurasthenias and hysteria,
milder forms of periodic psychosis, inhibitions against the
unfoldment of psychic energies (intelligence, moral sense),
including moral inferiority, especially associated with
hyper-sexuality, eventually leading to most serious disorders of the
sexual instinct. At any rate, it can be shown that, relatively
speaking, heterosexuals prove greater cynics about sexual
matters than the homosexuals. Also that other degenerative
signs upon the field of sexuality, such as sadism, masochism,
fetichism, etc., are much more commonly found among the

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> I find a very interesting observation by <i>Bloch</i>, one which
deserves to be widely circulated: “A final and not unimportant
form of Pseudo-homosexuality is hermaphroditism (<i>das Zwittertum</i>).
It is remarkable that science has concerned itself
only in recent years with the close study of hermaphroditic
conditions which have not received heretofore the attention
warranted by their sociologic bearings and their frequency. It
is a great merit of <i>Neugebauer</i> and of <i>Magnus Hirschfeld</i>
that they have called general attention to these remarkable
sexual <i>Zwischenstufen</i>, intermediary states, and have pointed
out their great practical significance, a matter of which no
one has thought before, as is shown by the significant fact
that the new German civil code has done away with the legal
proscriptions of the old Prussian law concerning the <i>Zwitter</i>
(hermaphrodites), upon the contention that no person is of
unknown or unascertainable sex.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Hirschfeld emphasizes the fact that homosexuality has nothing
to do with organic bisexuality. He states:</p>

<p>“I deem it important to point out this fact: <i>The most
extreme</i> deviation of sexual type approaching the opposite
sex, such as hypertrophy of the clitoris and full facial hair
growth in the female, or hypospadia penis-scrotalis and gynecomasty
in the male are found linked with heterosexuality
more often than with homosexuality.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Hirschfeld relates several instances illustrating how heterosexual
potence may be increased by the fires of homosexual
passion: A merchant relates: “I am able to carry out sexual
intercourse with women, only if I keep thinking of the man
who possessed the woman before me.” A young workingman
from Berlin relates: “When I was 17 years of age and I saw
young men of my age pick out sweethearts for themselves I did
the same. Later, as man, it seemed natural to me to get a
woman, although my own inclination had little to do with it.
The physical excitation necessary for the carrying out of the
sexual act I could rouse in myself only by thinking of some
male person. This sort of thing exhausted me and after a
time I decided to give it up. I felt myself strongly attracted
to a relative at that time. He was younger and as I had
greater influence over women I helped him by putting him in
touch with some and so we often carried out coitus together.
Seeing him [go at it so hotly] excited me tremendously and
then I carried out coitus without any difficulty.” The proprietor
of a German hotel also relates that, before intercourse
with his wife, he was in the habit of rousing his passion by
kissing his head waiter. This furnished him the requisite sexual
preparedness and as quickly as possible he hurried to his wife,
whose bed was in the next room. Hirschfeld writes further:
“These sketches from life I want to conclude with the account
of a patient who consulted me for sexual hyperesthesia which
in his case was so keen that seeing the statuettes of naked
children ornamenting the Berlin castle bridge while crossing
it was enough to cause erection. He was a merchant, 42 years
of age. In order to obtain potentia coeundi it was necessary
for him not only to think, but also to speak aloud of some
pleasing man, in some such manner: “Did you notice that
servant of the Count’s, who called for a bundle this forenoon,
how did you like him? A neat boy, what? His livery seemed
quite new! Didn’t you think it fitted him a bit too tightly?
How old should you say he was?” Only by carrying on such
talk with his wife, and he had to exercise the greatest ingenuity
in order to cover his object while doing so, was he
able to achieve ejaculation, and to beget children,—he was the
father of three.”</p>

only an episode and presently he is again restlessly searching
until he finds Helena, the most beautiful of all women. The
Flying Dutchman is released by a woman who remains true to
the last in her love of him. That is the projection of a subjective
feeling upon the woman. He wishes he could find a
woman for whom he would feel a love so dear that it would
relieve him. In Ahasuerus the same problem is glossed over
with religious terms as the problem seen in the Don Juan
story as the requital of the all-highest father. All four must be
faithless, they cannot remain true to one woman.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Once I treated a man who had separated from his wife,
wanted to marry another woman with whom he had fallen
in love and to divorce his wife. In the course of our interviews
during that time this man said repeatedly: “I would not
introduce you to my first wife; you would fall in love with her
if I did; no man can help that.” At once I recognized that
the man’s neurotic disorder reached back to a suppressed love
for his wife. In his mind there rumbled continually sounds
which he could not reproduce. He recalled scraps of melodies
which he could not place at all. But once I was able to get
at one such melody. It was a song of which he did not know
the words. When the matter was ferreted out it was found
that the words bore distinctly a reference to his first wife.
The vague melodies permitted his mind to dwell on her and
at the same time to cover from his consciousness the fact that
he could not keep her out of his mind. Here is a characteristic
passage from <i>Eichendorff’s</i> poem:</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> If homosexuals had only homosexual dreams, as <i>Naecke</i>
maintains, the fact would stand as a strong proof against my
conception that all men, including the homosexuals, are bisexual.
But as a matter of fact genuine homosexuals often have
heterosexual dreams if one cares to look into the subject
carefully. <i>Hirschfeld</i>, through a questionnaire, found that
among 100 homosexuals, 13 per cent. dreamed all sorts of
heterosexual situations. Analytical investigation of their
dream life would lift the 13 per cent. fully to one hundred
per cent. The heterosexual dreams are associated with anxiety
feelings in many cases. They dream that they are married
and find themselves impotent, so that they are confronted with
the compulsion of carrying out heterosexual intercourse. We
find here one more confirmation of the fact that the dream
releases all the excitations repressed from consciousness through
the day.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The following statement of <i>Hans Freimark</i> on the <i>Züchtbarkeit
der Homosexualität</i> displays excellent insight into human
nature: “It does not require much psychology to note
that some persons are particularly impressed by and interested
in whatever popular belief ascribes as particularly characteristic
of homosexuality. Repression against homosexual deeds
is in itself almost invincible. But that which is considered
the very essence of homosexuality acts apart and frequently
does so in a sense far from proper. It is enough to
induce young men who have no other claim to distinctions to
try to imitate these ‘singular doings’ and they become finally
interested in the acts.... Once the pose is assumed, it becomes
part of reality, and then contact with the homosexual circle
contributes not a little towards strengthening the attitude.
Such an influence, naturally, is possible only among young people.
But the young are the ones who generally raise the problem
at all. It has been assumed that in view of the constancy
of the instinct, such a complete shifting from one sex to the
opposite is most unlikely. But since all investigators admit a
certain period of indifference, and since it is admitted further
that during that period the individual may abandon himself
to an eroticism contrary to the form adopted finally, the possibility
cannot be excluded that weak characters may be turned
away from their original developmental goal.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Interesting is also the case of a high school teacher whose
feelings were predominantly homosexual during the stage of
depression and heterosexual during the stage of exaltation
induced by the addiction to morphine (<i>Hirschfeld</i>). There
are persons who live a double, alternating existence: homosexual
and heterosexual. Their conduct suggests that they
are persons continually in search of a bisexual ideal. Krafft-Ebing
also describes a hysterical (<i>Jahrbuch f. Sexuelle
Zwischenstufen</i>, vol. III) who is attracted to men each time
that her neurosis improves after a sojourn at a sanitarium,
while during the height of her trouble she is homosexual.
What does this mean but that the heterosexual cravings are
repressed during her neurosis! For notwithstanding her extensive
homosexual gratifications she has become a victim of
severe hysteria while every time she improves she feels the
love for man.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> It is not true that homosexuals are exposed to no dangers
of infection. I have examined a homosexual druggist who
acquired in Venice a serious gonorrhea of the anus. He
confessed to me that he had infected other men, because the
thought of having fallen himself a victim made him angry.
But on the whole infections are not so frequent an occurrence
as during heterosexual intercourse, which is what would be
expected, considering that <i>copulatio analis</i> is relatively rare.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> I must also emphasize that the first homosexual activity
often takes place in the twenties, if we omit from consideration
the mutual gratifications between boys and between girls
which—with but very few exceptions—are found to occur
during the childhood of all persons. Between small children
(4-8 years of age) homosexual activity is very common, then
in many cases a period of latency seems to set in. During
the period from the 10th to the 15th year nearly every boy
passes through homosexual love (either purely platonic or
grossly sexual). After the onset of puberty there are
numerous variations: persons who later become homosexual continue
heterosexual activity, try all sorts of experiments and
then withdraw into homosexuality in consequence of some
unpleasant heterosexual experience (infection, claim of parenthood,
etc.) or on account of impotence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> As is well known <i>Bloch</i> has endeavored to show that

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> We shall see later that this attitude is due to the fact that
these persons fix their whole heterosexual psychic eroticism
upon the immediate members of their family. Heterosexual
men in this situation often experience merely physical gratification
during intercourse with prostitutes; with the other
type of women they are wholly impotent.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> The following statement of <i>Hirschfeld’s</i> illustrates this
point (l.c., p. 315): “An urning, writer,—<i>unus e multis</i>—writes
me: ‘The homosexual inclination developed in me in spite of
the fact that the first sexual aggression was of a heterosexual
character—a nursemaid seduced me—in spite of the
fact that through training from childhood on I was taught
to look at the female sex and my reading of literature showed
me that woman was the object of love.’” I add: this tendency
developed because the first sexual experience was associated
with disgust on his part and because the domineering of
woman led him to hate that sex.</p>

because it describes accurately the homosexual practices in a
school of cadets. The fact that young boys are impelled to
think of their mother when visiting the brothel for the first
time is often the cause of total impotence. Cf. <i>Weininger</i>:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
